In this paper, we propose a bias-dependent (i.e., drain voltage (VDS) dependent) capacitance extraction of an NSFET using a de-mirroring approach. The electric field coupling from the drain to the source impacts the capacitances. The obtained results reveal that the mirroring approach overestimates the capacitances by ~15%, which is accurately predicted by our proposed de-mirroring approach.","Deven H Patil,Sandeep Kumar,Sunil Rathore,Sudeb Dasgupta,Navjeet Bagga",07 Modelling and Simulation,0,,"Deven H Patil,Sandeep Kumar,Sunil Rathore,Sudeb Dasgupta,Navjeet Bagga, Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, India "

Scaled to channel lengths as short as 45 nm, the integration process remains BEOL-compatible. Additionally, we present a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic platform using 3D monolithic integration of WSe₂ n-FETs and p-FETs, demonstrating high-performance CMOS gates with inter-tier via connections under 1 µm. We further explore heterogeneous integration by stacking graphene-based chemisensors with MoS₂ memtransistors in a two-tier architecture, achieving 62,500 I/O per mm² and low-latency near-sensor computing.

Therefore, a number of researches are in progress to improve capacitance performance by lowering effective k-value of inter-metal dielectric (IMD) materials. For conventional IMD materials such as low-k (LK) and ultra low-k (ULK), those are vulnerable to the plasma induced damage (PID) during BEOL integration. As a consequence, an effective k-value of IMD must be deteriorated easily, which leads to serious performance degradation. In this paper, we developed high density low-k (HDLK) materials with higher PID resistance by using a new type of precursor, which is capable of generating bridged-carbon bonding (Si-C-Si). We achieved the 30% reduction of PID with HDLK compared to the conventional IMD. As a result, it resulted in the improvement of the BEOL interconnect capacitance by 3%. Throughout these results, we applied HDLK as a basic IMD material in narrow pitch layers of BEOL interconnect. In addition, we developed a different type of film with same precursor by tuning process conditions, which is called a high density ultra low-k (HDULK). This film is applicable to wider pitches of interconnect owing to remarkable characteristics such as lower k-value, good process integrity. Even though we utilized various precursors for each IMD materials in the past, HDLK and HDULK can be implemented by using just one single precursor. Thus, it is strongly expected to contribute to cost reduction.","Kang Sub YIM,Jong Min Baek,Hoon Seok Seo,Sungbin Park,Geun Tae Yun,Yeonggil Kim,Deokyoung Jung,Kyeongbeom Park,Jangho Lee",01 Materials,1,[Invited],"Kangsub Yim, Samsung, South Korea "

Active control of spin waves is essential for practical realization of magnonic technology. Here we introduce nanoscale magnonic Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators, waveguides, and magnonic crystals (MCs) for low-loss spin-wave guiding and manipulation. These devices are made of an array of ferromagnetic metal (FM) nanostripes patterned on a low-damping yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. In an array of magnonic FP resonators where two edges of each FM stripe act as two sharp magnetic interfaces, propagating spin waves coherently circulate between the two magnetic interfaces of the resonator and interfere destructively to form transmission gaps with the depth down to the background level. Thus-formed gaps, called as FP gaps, can be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states and efficiently tuned over a wide frequency range via the variation of the stripe width, strip number, and film thickness. When the period between FP resonators meets the Bragg condition, the MCs with deep gaps and low-loss minibands are produced. The MC gaps can also be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states. Moreover, these FP and MC gaps are strongly hybridized when approaching each other, resulting in the gap anti-crossing.  In the magnonic waveguide, the downshift of spin-wave dispersion due to the small effective magnetic field in the YIG and FM region enables the guiding of spin-wave propagation along the nanostripe. We report on low-loss spin-wave channeling in straight and curved nanoscopic waveguides, and further demonstrate reversible control of the spin-wave propagation by changing the frequency and magnetic bias field in a hybrid waveguiding structure.

VCOs provide a compact, energy-efficient solution by directly converting DC power into the microwave B1 field required for NV center control, bypassing conventional RF amplification stages. Additionally, the VCO’s intrinsic frequency agility, enabled by the varactor inside the LC tank, which simultaneously changes the resonant frequency of the LC resonator and the oscillation frequency, ensures a near-constant B1 field across the tuning range. Current state-of-the-art chip-integrated diamond magnetometers, while showing promising results, typically make use of classical transmitter architectures, in general, providing a lower energy efficiency compared to the presented VCO-based approach. With its very good energy efficiency, the proposed VCO-based approach offers a path to scalable, low-power NV-based magnetometers suitable for portable and embedded applications. To provide a sufficiently large active area for typical diamond samples, the presented VCO-based $B_1$ generator uses an array of four injection-locked VCOs. An on-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) precisely defines the frequency of the B1 field from an external reference.

This study employs density functional theory (DFT) simulations to investigate three key aspects: the formation of native defects during device fabrication, the degradation process through defect generation, and the impact of defects electrical properties of h-BN. Our findings reveal that nitrogen vacancies are the most common defects in h-BN, with a formation energy of approximately 3.5 eV lower than that of boron vacancies and it has a strong effect on the electrical properties of h-BN. The presence of water molecules during metal deposition significantly reduces the formation energy of both nitrogen and boron vacancies by 4 eV and 5.5 eV respectively, highlighting the importance of high-vacuum fabrication environments. We identify two primary degradation pathways of h-BN: an in-plane and out-of-plane defect propagation compatible with filament formation in resistive switching applications, and a layer-confined defect generation that can lead to increased device variability. These results provide crucial insights for improving the reliability of h-BN-based devices and optimizing their performance in various applications, including memristors and transistors.","Marco A.

In this work, we propose RRAM-based isotropic CNNs that enhance model robustness and improve resource utilization concurrently. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the isotropic CNNs yield up to 3.74% and 12.61% accuracy improvement under quantization and non-idealities, respectively. Moreover, they increase the utilization rate by 5.2-13.4% in typical network architectures.

By integrating physics-based features with data-driven methodologies, this model facilitates transparent, interpretable, and actionable insights into magnetization reversal processes, addressing longstanding challenges in mesoscale physics.
Magnetization reversal in nanomagnets is a cornerstone phenomenon for advancing spintronic devices, demanding novel analytical approaches to decode its complexity. Leveraging the capabilities of the extended Landau free-energy model alongside topological data analysis (TDA), this research bridges the gap between microstructures and macroscopic properties. Persistent homology (PH), ridge regression (RR), and principal component analysis (PCA) are employed to quantify magnetic domain complexities, identify energy contributions, and visualize magnetization dynamics. This integrated framework not only reveals the causal relationships driving energy barriers and domain transitions but also offers a pathway for energy-efficient and highly optimized magnetic device design.

For instance, there are no large, reliable datasets available for several key ‘performance determining’ metrics in energy applications, such as diffusivities in battery electrodes, carrier recombination rates in photovoltaics, and molecular adsorption energies for catalysis. On the other hand, there are reasonably ‘large' datasets (> 100,000 datapoints) available on some properties, such as, bulk formation enthalpies, computed band structures, and crystal structures across wide chemical spaces. Thus, if key chemical, compositional, and structural trends can be captured in available large datasets and subsequently transferred (or re-learnt), it will enable the use of deep learning and graph based neural network models in smaller datasets as well. Hence, my talk will explore the utility of current transfer learning (TL) approaches that are available for computational materials science and identify optimal ways to employ TL-based strategies. Specifically, TL involves training a neural network model on a larger dataset and subsequently retraining a fraction of the model on a smaller dataset. I will quantify the accuracy, transferability, and efficiency of TL models compared to models that have been trained from scratch. Finally, I will focus on TL models that can generalise over multi-properties during pre-training and can efficiently be re-trained on small datasets, which pave the way towards creating more general, foundational models, in the near future.","Sai Gautam Gopalakrishnan,Reshma Devi,Keith Butler",EDS Special Session,1,,"Prof. Sai Gautam Gopalakrishnan, Indian Institute of Science, Inida "

Additive manufacturing (AM) is one such transformative technique that allows creation of components with complex geometries layer-by-layer that are prohibitively difficult to achieve with traditional manufacturing techniques. Existing commercial and open-source software allow users to carry out materials simulations but lack predictive power to model manufacturing processes with complex thermal history and do not allow users the flexibility to design microstructures and hence functionality tailored to suit their specific needs. We aim to overcome this critical barrier by developing a high-performance user-friendly Digital Twin that will enable end users to exhaustively explore, identify and design time-dependent AM protocols that achieve tailor-made microstructures. A subset of the processing conditions that lead to the most promising microstructures and functionality will then be experimentally manufactured and validated. Our Digital Twin employs a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) based model of the AM process to simulate microstructural evolution for a diverse set of experimentally relevant processing conditions and uses AI/ML to explore the relationship between microstructural features and processing conditions.

We found that under DC stress, the device changes from a significant non-polarized characteristics to a gradually increased polarization in the low-voltage range. Therefore, it is understood the device exhibits a certain phase transition from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic phase. The polarization decreases after a long time of recovery, suggesting it returns to a state close to the initial state.

Besides, the enhanced surface scattering can lower surface conductivity, resulting in cross-sectional current crowding and potentially decreasing the interconnect's electromigration resistance. Through finite element simulation, this work demonstrates the appearance of this extra decrement when the positive feedback between the Joule heat and resistivity is enhanced. As the metal's electric and thermal conductivity degrade with scaling, the cross-sectional crowding effect becomes significant, resulting in the electromigration stress increment by 10%, 33%, and 7% for Cu, Co, and Ru compared to the uniform current case at 9 nm thickness. This work reveals a potential influence on EM lifetime at advanced technology nodes and highlights Ru as an alternative interconnect metal that can effectively resist this adverse effect.","Yichen Wen,Shuying Wang,Xiaoman Yang,Hai-Bao Chen,Maokun Wu,Runsheng Wang,Zhigang Ji,Ru Huang",07 Modelling and Simulation,0,,"Yichen Wen,Shuying Wang,Xiaoman Yang,Hai-Bao Chen,Maokun Wu,Runsheng Wang,Zhigang Ji,Ru Huang, National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Micro/Nano Fabrication, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China "

Our experiments show that Flicker noise is obviously affected by high temperature, and shows different temperature dependence under different gate bias. That is, at low gate bias, high temperature makes the flicker noise of the device lower than that at room temperature, while at high gate bias, high temperature makes the flicker noise of the device higher than that at room temperature. A new physical-based model is used to analyze the temperature dependence of flicker noise. The decrease of high temperature noise at low bias is mainly affected by the decrease of Hooge parameter, and the increase of high temperature noise at high bias is mainly affected by the access resistance induced noise. This increase in noise due to high temperatures is likely to be more significant in future GAAFET and CFET devices.","Sheng Yang,Shuying Wang,Chenyang Zhang,Yongkang Xue,Pengpeng Ren,Zhigang Ji",08 Reliability and testing,0,,"Sheng Yang,Shuying Wang,Chenyang Zhang,Yongkang Xue,Pengpeng Ren,Zhigang Ji, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China "
