Therefore, a number of researches are in progress to improve capacitance performance by lowering effective k-value of inter-metal dielectric (IMD) materials. For conventional IMD materials such as low-k (LK) and ultra low-k (ULK), those are vulnerable to the plasma induced damage (PID) during BEOL integration. As a consequence, an effective k-value of IMD must be deteriorated easily, which leads to serious performance degradation. In this paper, we developed high density low-k (HDLK) materials with higher PID resistance by using a new type of precursor, which is capable of generating bridged-carbon bonding (Si-C-Si). We achieved the 30% reduction of PID with HDLK compared to the conventional IMD. As a result, it resulted in the improvement of the BEOL interconnect capacitance by 3%. Throughout these results, we applied HDLK as a basic IMD material in narrow pitch layers of BEOL interconnect. In addition, we developed a different type of film with same precursor by tuning process conditions, which is called a high density ultra low-k (HDULK). This film is applicable to wider pitches of interconnect owing to remarkable characteristics such as lower k-value, good process integrity. Even though we utilized various precursors for each IMD materials in the past, HDLK and HDULK can be implemented by using just one single precursor. Thus, it is strongly expected to contribute to cost reduction.","Kang Sub YIM,Jong Min Baek,Hoon Seok Seo,Sungbin Park,Geun Tae Yun,Yeonggil Kim,Deokyoung Jung,Kyeongbeom Park,Jangho Lee",01 Materials,1.0

Active control of spin waves is essential for practical realization of magnonic technology. Here we introduce nanoscale magnonic Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators, waveguides, and magnonic crystals (MCs) for low-loss spin-wave guiding and manipulation. These devices are made of an array of ferromagnetic metal (FM) nanostripes patterned on a low-damping yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. In an array of magnonic FP resonators where two edges of each FM stripe act as two sharp magnetic interfaces, propagating spin waves coherently circulate between the two magnetic interfaces of the resonator and interfere destructively to form transmission gaps with the depth down to the background level. Thus-formed gaps, called as FP gaps, can be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states and efficiently tuned over a wide frequency range via the variation of the stripe width, strip number, and film thickness. When the period between FP resonators meets the Bragg condition, the MCs with deep gaps and low-loss minibands are produced. The MC gaps can also be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states. Moreover, these FP and MC gaps are strongly hybridized when approaching each other, resulting in the gap anti-crossing.  In the magnonic waveguide, the downshift of spin-wave dispersion due to the small effective magnetic field in the YIG and FM region enables the guiding of spin-wave propagation along the nanostripe. We report on low-loss spin-wave channeling in straight and curved nanoscopic waveguides, and further demonstrate reversible control of the spin-wave propagation by changing the frequency and magnetic bias field in a hybrid waveguiding structure.

This study employs density functional theory (DFT) simulations to investigate three key aspects: the formation of native defects during device fabrication, the degradation process through defect generation, and the impact of defects electrical properties of h-BN. Our findings reveal that nitrogen vacancies are the most common defects in h-BN, with a formation energy of approximately 3.5 eV lower than that of boron vacancies and it has a strong effect on the electrical properties of h-BN. The presence of water molecules during metal deposition significantly reduces the formation energy of both nitrogen and boron vacancies by 4 eV and 5.5 eV respectively, highlighting the importance of high-vacuum fabrication environments. We identify two primary degradation pathways of h-BN: an in-plane and out-of-plane defect propagation compatible with filament formation in resistive switching applications, and a layer-confined defect generation that can lead to increased device variability.

With the self-selective memristors and scalable in-memory WHT method, arbitrarily-size WHT computing can be realized with a fixed-size memristor array, and image compression is achieved with a small result error that the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the compressed result is 32 dB. In addition, non-ideal characteristics in devices and arrays are analyzed and compared with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), which shows that in-memory WHT has higher robustness.","Jing Tian,Huai-Zhi Pei,Jian-Cong Li,Xiao-Di Huang,Yi Li,Xiang-Shui Miao,Yi-Bai Xue",04 Memory Technologies,0.0
1367,Enabling Floating Body Effect in Bulk-Si Transistor for Area and Energy-Efficient Spiking Neuron,March 2025 (Wednesday),3:30pm,afternoon," INNO2 Multifunction Hall 1, 2/F, 17W",EDTM25-000293,"Ultra-compact and energy-efficient circuits are crucial for edge application. In the literature, an area and energy-efficient circuit based on band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) using partially depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (PDSOI) MOSFETs with standard SOI technology has been proposed. However, PD-SOI technology is costly due to the expensive “smart-cut” method to fabricate SOI wafers. Therefore, in this work, we propose a bulk MOSFET design with separate body contact and laminated well technique to enable BTBT's current collection. This is followed by the implementation of a Leaky integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron using mixed-mode simulation in TCAD with a well-calibrated deck to demonstrate spiking neuron. The simulation confirms that the laminated wells successfully enable hole storage in the body, facilitating effective LIF neuron operation in bulk technology.","Shubham Patil,Hemant Hajare,Abhishek Kadam,Jay Sonawane,Shreyas Deshmukh,Veeresh Deshpande,Udayan Ganguly",07 Modelling and Simulation,0.0

However, a significant challenge remains: the absence of accurate models for optimizing the SPAD design prior to fabrication. In this paper, we present a comprehensive noise model and compare simulation results with experimental measurements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness and the necessity of robust SPAD modeling for design optimization as a critical step before fabrication.","Wei Jiang,Jamal Deen,Xuanyu Qian",07 Modelling and Simulation,0.0

1384,Impact of Cross-Sectional Current Crowding on Electromigration in Interconnects,March 2025 (Wednesday),4:45pm,afternoon," INNO2 Multifunction Hall 1, 2/F, 17W",EDTM25-000325,"As the critical dimensions of interconnect scaling, the enhancement of surface scattering increases the resistivity, contributing to the reduction in electromigration lifetime. Besides, the enhanced surface scattering can lower surface conductivity, resulting in cross-sectional current crowding and potentially decreasing the interconnect's electromigration resistance. Through finite element simulation, this work demonstrates the appearance of this extra decrement when the positive feedback between the Joule heat and resistivity is enhanced. As the metal's electric and thermal conductivity degrade with scaling, the cross-sectional crowding effect becomes significant, resulting in the electromigration stress increment by 10%, 33%, and 7% for Cu, Co, and Ru compared to the uniform current case at 9 nm thickness. This work reveals a potential influence on EM lifetime at advanced technology nodes and highlights Ru as an alternative interconnect metal that can effectively resist this adverse effect.","Yichen Wen,Shuying Wang,Xiaoman Yang,Hai-Bao Chen,Maokun Wu,Runsheng Wang,Zhigang Ji,Ru Huang",07 Modelling and Simulation,0.0
