0,EDTM25-000004,Energy-Efficient Voltage-Induced Self-Regulated Precessional MRAM with Low Write Error Rate <10^−9,"Voltage-controlled precessional MRAM offers a good power-performance-area balance, positioning it as a promising intermediate memory between SRAM, DRAM, and flash. However, its practical implementation is hindered by the need for highly precise timing control of the incoming voltage pulse, making it susceptible to process, temperature, and other variations, compromising its robustness for memory applications. This study proposes voltage-induced self-regulated precessional (VISP) memory to address this issue. By using angular dependence of MTJ’s resistance, energy asymmetry is created so that the precession is self-terminated without external control. The robustness of switching is evaluated using Fokker-Planck simulations, and it was found that write-error rate < 10^-9 can be achieved with a pulse width of ~ 26 nanoseconds, making VISP well-suited for storage-class memory.","Stanislav Sin,Saeroonter Oh","stas94@skku.edu,sroonter@skku.edu",07 Modelling and Simulation,final_submitted,"MRAM,Storage-class memory,VCMA",manuscript.pdf,14,9,2,5,6,5.564266631770237,1.33,1.21,0,0,2,Dr.,Stanislav,Sin,stas94@skku.edu,Sungkyunkwan University,"Korea, Republic of",no,yes,yes,yes

3,EDTM25-000009,A Novel Mixed Collector Structure IGBT Operating at High Temperature,"This work proposes a novel insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) with a mixed N-region collector (MNC-IGBT). The addition of a thin N-type doped region within the P-type collector serves to effectively reduce the amplification effect of the internal parasitic PNP transistor on the leakage current in the off-state. As a result，MNC-IGBT markedly reduces the leakage current and increases the operational temperature of the device. The simulation results demonstrate that the leakage current of the MNC-IGBT is reduced by 9% and 8%, respectively, at 175°C and 200°C in comparison to conventional CSTBT, while maintaining a higher breakdown voltage even at 215°C. Furthermore, the on-state voltage drop (Von) and switching losses (Eon, Eoff)of MNC-IGBT are close to those of the CSTBT. The excellent performance of MNC-IGBT provides a reliable solution for increasing the operating temperature of IGBTs.","Changhao Wang,hang Xu,Jianbin Guo,xinru Chen,YaFen Yang,David wei Zhang","24112020097@m.fudan.edu.cn,hang_xu@fudan.edu.cn,23112020069@m.fudan.edu.cn,xinruchen24@m.fudan.edu.cn,yafen_yang@fudan.edu.cn,dwzhang@fudan.edu.cn",07 Modelling and Simulation,final_submitted,,A Novel Mixed Collector Structure IGBT Operating at ultra-high temperature2024.pdf,14,7,4,7,4,6.1328125,1.00,2.55,0,0,6,Dr.,hang,Xu,hang_xu@fudan.edu.cn,"School of Microelectronics, Fudan University",China,no,yes,yes,yes

We find that the MW first increases and then remains almost constant with the increasing thickness of the top Al2O3 interlayer. This phenomenon is attributed to the smaller electric field of the ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 in the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al2O3 interlayer after a program operation, which makes the charges injected from the metal gate trapped at the top Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 interface cannot remain.","Tao Hu,Runhao Han,Xinpei Jia,Jia Yang,Zeqi Chen,Xiaoqing Sun,Junshuai Chai,Hao Xu,Xiaolei Wang,Wenwu Wang,Tianchun Ye","hutao2022@ime.ac.cn,hanrunhao@ime.ac.cn,jiaxinpei@ime.ac.cn,yangjia@ime.ac.cn,chenzeqi24@ime.ac.cn,sunxiaoqing@ime.ac.cn,chaijunshuai@ime.ac.cn,xuhao@ime.ac.cn,wangxiaolei@ime.ac.cn,wangwenwu@ime.ac.cn,tcye@ime.ac.cn","02 Process, Tools, Yield, and Manufacturing",final_submitted,"FeFETs,memory window,MIFIS gate structure",TaoHu_2025EDTM_PaperV1.pdf,9,2,1,7,7,7.463659365465235,2.00,1.29,0,0,11,Mr.,Tao,Hu,hutao2022@ime.ac.cn,Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,China,no,yes,yes,yes

124,EDTM25-000195,Surrogate MTJ Model for Early-stage  MRAM Macro Reliability Analysis,"As emerging magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device has been gradually optimized, magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) macro performance requires early-stage estimation and implementation based on SPICE compatible model. This work analyzes the main physical characteristics of MTJ and proposes a novel reliable surrogate model for early-stage MRAM performance evaluation. The model adjusts write voltage and timing according to error correcting code (ECC) capability and facilitates the evaluation of write power consumption. The model is validated with a 55-nm CMOS process, with a critical dimension of 78-nm MTJ and a 0.216 µm2 single bit-cell layout area. The surrogate model fits the MTJ magnetoresistance across a wide range of temperatures, voltages and prevents from endurance degradation.

Specifically, well-calibrated pixel-to-pixel variance and specific photoresponse statistics of the raw output data help to identify the unavoidable error contributions from individual pixels, thus enabling compensation through computational image processing or readout circuits. This is particularly vital for emerging image sensors based on 2D materials integrated with silicon, which often utilize readout circuits distinct from traditional CCD and CMOS sensors. This work investigates pixel-to-pixel variance in graphene-silicon Schottky photodiodes, assessing the feasibility of large-scale fabrication, uniformity of dark current, and photoresponse in small-scale arrays.

200,EDTM25-000299,Hardware Virtualization Technology for Multicore Brain-inspired Chip,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, a new type of AI accelerators, known as the Brain-inspired Chip (BIC), has emerged in Non-von Neumann computing environments, such as SpiNNaker, Loihi, TrueNorth and Tianjic. However, contemporary BICs often exhibit low resource utilization due to the imbalance in hardware resource allocation across various models, which is exacerbated by the lack of virtualization support. Although prior efforts have explored (para-) virtualization techniques to share resources of other AI accelerators such as GPU, these attempts have failed to account for key characteristics of BIC such as interconnection between multiple BIC cores and scratchpad-centric memory, leading to suboptimal performance. 
This paper presents vBIC, a comprehensive BIC virtualization solution featuring two key architectural extensions: (1) BIC memory virtualization which reduces TLB misses and table walking times for scratchpad-centric memory access; and (2) BIC interconnection virtualization which establishes a virtual topology among multiple BIC cores. We have implemented a prototype of vBIC on an FPGA platform. Evaluation results show that vBIC maintains end-to-end performance across various AI workloads. Furthermore, when compared with alternative approaches such as unified virtual memory, vBIC achieves a 2x performance improvement in transformer-based models.","Dahu Feng,Rong Zhao","fengdh21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,r_zhao@tsinghua.edu.cn","13 Disruptive Technologies (Metaverse, Neuromorphic Computing, Quantum Computing) ",final_submitted," Brain-inspired Chip, Neuromorphic Computing, Virtualization",EDTM_vBIC.pdf,10,6,0,4,2,5.3125,0.50,0.66,0,0,2,Prof.,Rong,Zhao,r_zhao@tsinghua.edu.cn,Tsinghua University,China,no,yes,yes,yes

At 3.6 GHz, the higher maximum output current density of 11.3 W/mm is realized by UBD HEMTs, with a maximum power-added efficiency (PAE) of 57%.

202,EDTM25-000302,Simulation Optimization of Embedded Microchannel Heat Sink for GaN HEMTs ,"As the power density of Gallium Nitride (GaN)-based devices increases, heat dissipation becomes a major challenge. Embedded micro-channel heat sink have attracted much attention because of their high heat dissipation performance. In this paper, a GaN High-Electron-Mobility Transistor (HEMTs) model is established, and the effects of micro-channel geometry parameters (depth, width, spacing) and cooling fluid rate on heat dissipation performance are investigated by COMSOL Multiphysics. The pressure drop across the coolant inlet and outlet needs to be balanced while achieving effective cooling. With this trade-off, an optimal combination of microfluidic channel dimensions was obtained: depth of 200 μm, width of 100 μm, spacing of 80 μm. An increase in the flow rate of the cooling fluid generally corresponds with enhanced heat dissipation capabilities. Again, there is a trade-off between coolant pressure drop and flow rate to achieve high heat dissipation performance. Finally, in conjunction with the optimality conditions obtained from the simulation, the maximum temperature of the device is 135.5 ℃, which is 45.5 ℃ lower than that of the device without embedded microchannel structure. In addition, the effects of different substrates on the temperature of the device are simulated. Embedded microchannels based on diamond substrates maximize the potential of liquid cooling. This paper provides theoretical and experimental basis for the design and optimization of embedded microchannel cooling structure, which is helpful to improve the heat dissipation performance of GaN devices.","Bowen Yang,Shiming Li,Mei Wu,Ling Yang,Bin Hou,Meng Zhang,Hao Lu,Xiaohua Ma,Yue Hao","ybw011211@163.com,smli@stu.xidian.edu.cn,wumei_xdu@163.com,yangling@xidian.edu.cn,houbinme@163.com,498078211@qq.com,luhao@xidian.edu.cn,xhma@xidian.edu.cn,yhao@xidian.edu.cn",07 Modelling and Simulation,final_submitted,"simulation,embedded microchannel heat sink,Gallium Nitride High-Electron-Mobility Transistor(GaN HEMTs) ",Microsoft Word - Optimization of GaN-on-SiC embedded microchannel heat sink based on simulation.pdf,14,9,3,5,5,6.189248113617509,1.60,1.26,0,0,9,Mr.,Bowen,Yang,ybw011211@163.com,Xidian University,China,no,yes,yes,yes

The carrier mobility of the TFTs can be significantly improved by adopting homostructure a-IGZO layers with various stoichiometric ratios. This improvement can be attributed to the raised carrier density in indium-rich a-IGZO because more donor-like oxygen vacancies are induced by the content of indium oxide, reducing the source/drain electrode contact resistance. Moreover, multiple channels can be formed in the homostructure, simultaneously contributing to carrier transport.

Besides, the enhanced surface scattering can lower surface conductivity, resulting in cross-sectional current crowding and potentially decreasing the interconnect's electromigration resistance. Through finite element simulation, this work demonstrates the appearance of this extra decrement when the positive feedback between the Joule heat and resistivity is enhanced. As the metal's electric and thermal conductivity degrade with scaling, the cross-sectional crowding effect becomes significant, resulting in the electromigration stress increment by 10%, 33%, and 7% for Cu, Co, and Ru compared to the uniform current case at 9 nm thickness.

227,EDTM25-000339,Enhanced Gate Stack Reliability Test Framework for GaN HEMT in High-Stress Environments Leveraging on Ramp and Constant Voltage Stress Protocols,"This study proposes an enhanced reliability testing framework for GaN transistors, utilizing two distinct reliability test protocols. The first protocol, a successive multi-stage compliance ramp voltage sweep (MSC-RVS), incrementally increases the voltage to the gate breakdown threshold with varying current compliance, allowing a detailed analysis of failure progression in GaN devices. MSC-RVS enables modeling of the physics of failure mechanisms as functions of temperature and voltage through stage-specific electrical and physical failure analysis. The second protocol employs a constant voltage stress (CVS) scheme, applying fixed current compliance while varying voltage levels. CVS testing under different voltage and temperature conditions supports parameter fitting of the physics of failure models, calibration, and subsequent device lifetime predictions (extrapolation). This study, conducted at room temperature, highlights a multimodal failure mechanism within the device, revealing different regions susceptible to degradation. Three primary failure regions were identified: Schottky, Passivation, and PiN, each associated with unique failure modes: (A) Schottky-only breakdown, (B) Schottky with passivation breakdown, and (C) combined Schottky with PiN/passivation breakdown.

232,EDTM25-000345,On the Understanding of  Temperature Dependence of Flicker Noise in Advanced FinFET Technology,"Temperature Dependence will complicate the noise problem of FinFET devices. Our experiments show that Flicker noise is obviously affected by high temperature, and shows different temperature dependence under different gate bias. That is, at low gate bias, high temperature makes the flicker noise of the device lower than that at room temperature, while at high gate bias, high temperature makes the flicker noise of the device higher than that at room temperature. A new physical-based model is used to analyze the temperature dependence of flicker noise. The decrease of high temperature noise at low bias is mainly affected by the decrease of Hooge parameter, and the increase of high temperature noise at high bias is mainly affected by the access resistance induced noise. This increase in noise due to high temperatures is likely to be more significant in future GAAFET and CFET devices.","Sheng Yang,Shuying Wang,Chenyang Zhang,Yongkang Xue,Pengpeng Ren,Zhigang Ji","yangsheng23@sjtu.edu.cn,5.1.yyy@sjtu.edu.cn,sjtu-dazui@sjtu.edu.cn,xueyongkang@sjtu.edu.cn,pengpengren@sjtu.edu.cn,zhigangji@sjtu.edu.cn",08 Reliability and testing,final_submitted,,Microsoft Word - edtm2025-paper-templateV2.pdf,10,6,0,4,2,6.249952382161723,1.50,2.32,0,0,6,Mr.,Sheng,Yang,yangsheng23@sjtu.edu.cn,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,China,no,yes,yes,yes

The iso-leakage frequency degrades up to 2.20% with layout misalignment of 4 nm. It’s found that the Drain Merge resistance degrades significantly with misalignment increasing and is identified as the major variation source.  Through careful DTCO with design rule optimization, the variation can be greatly suppressed, while the resistance fluctuation of the DM also drops substantially. Monte Carlo random experiments were also conducted, validating the variation reduction. Comparing with the CFET featuring self-aligned gate and much less overlay induced misalignment,  fortunately, FFET’s PP is still better except when misalignment reaches 8 nm, which is out of spec and nearly  impossible.

245,EDTM25-000363,A Novel De-Mirroring Approach for Bias-dependent Capacitance Extraction in Nanosheet FET using Conformal Mapping,"The sheets/channels are vertically stacked in Nanosheet FET (NSFET), which forms a complex capacitive network. Till date, to the best of our knowledge, the only bias-independent capacitance model for NSFET has been presented by considering that the device is mirrored symmetric around the center of the channel. This mirroring approach does not precisely address the nominal biasing conditions at the source and drain; thus, we need to model the two halves separately. In this paper, we propose a bias-dependent (i.e., drain voltage (VDS) dependent) capacitance extraction of an NSFET using a de-mirroring approach. The electric field coupling from the drain to the source impacts the capacitances. The obtained results reveal that the mirroring approach overestimates the capacitances by ~15%, which is accurately predicted by our proposed de-mirroring approach.","Deven H Patil,Sandeep Kumar,Sunil Rathore,Sudeb Dasgupta,Navjeet Bagga","22ec01040@iitbbs.ac.in,a23ec09004@iitbbs.ac.in,1912603@iiitdmj.ac.in,sudeb.dasgupta@ece.iitr.ac.in,navjeet@iitbbs.ac.in",07 Modelling and Simulation,final_submitted,,EDTM_DHP_Navjeet.pdf,14,8,3,6,5,6.501772804487814,1.60,1.73,0,0,5,Dr.,Navjeet,Bagga,navjeet@iitbbs.ac.in,Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar,India,no,yes,yes,yes

250,EDTM25-000369,Enhanced Thermal Conductivity in BN Composite Films for Highly Integrated  Electronics and Flexible Devices,"In flexible and stretchable electronic devices, as well as in highly integrated and miniaturized high-performance electronic products, thermal interface materials (TIMs) play an important role in maintaining. However, widely used flexible polymers such as PI and PDMS have inherently poor thermal conductivity, leading to issues with heat dissipation. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to enhance thermal conductivity by creating polymer composites using materials such as carbon, metals, and ceramics. Among these materials, hexagonal boron nitride(h-BN) stands out as an excellent candidate for TIMs due to its high thermal conductivity, superior insulation, and excellent chemical stability. However, h-BN exhibits high in-plane thermal conductivity (600 W/m-1K-1) and relatively low through-plane thermal conductivity (30 W/m-1K-1). Consequently, recent research has focused on improving the vertical thermal conductivity of composites containing h-BN.
In this study, a film capable of anisotropic dissipation was produced through a tetrahedral structure using BN nanosheets. The film includes flexibility and elasticity without degrading thermal conductivity during deformation and improves vertical thermal conductivity. In addition, this film effectively reduced the heat generated by the LED.

For instance, there are no large, reliable datasets available for several key ‘performance determining’ metrics in energy applications, such as diffusivities in battery electrodes, carrier recombination rates in photovoltaics, and molecular adsorption energies for catalysis. On the other hand, there are reasonably ‘large' datasets (> 100,000 datapoints) available on some properties, such as, bulk formation enthalpies, computed band structures, and crystal structures across wide chemical spaces. Thus, if key chemical, compositional, and structural trends can be captured in available large datasets and subsequently transferred (or re-learnt), it will enable the use of deep learning and graph based neural network models in smaller datasets as well. Hence, my talk will explore the utility of current transfer learning (TL) approaches that are available for computational materials science and identify optimal ways to employ TL-based strategies. Specifically, TL involves training a neural network model on a larger dataset and subsequently retraining a fraction of the model on a smaller dataset. I will quantify the accuracy, transferability, and efficiency of TL models compared to models that have been trained from scratch. Finally, I will focus on TL models that can generalise over multi-properties during pre-training and can efficiently be re-trained on small datasets, which pave the way towards creating more general, foundational models, in the near future.","Sai Gautam Gopalakrishnan,Reshma Devi,Keith Butler","saigautamg@iisc.ac.in,reshmadevi@iisc.ac.in,k.t.butler@ucl.ac.uk",15 Short course/tutorial (invited),final_submitted,"transfer learning,materials properties,multi-property training",edtm2025-paper-template-word-sgg.pdf,2,1,0,1,2,0,-,0.88,1,0,3,Prof.,Sai Gautam,Gopalakrishnan,saigautamg@iisc.ac.in,Indian Institute of Science,India,no,yes,yes,yes

We found that under DC stress, the device changes from a significant non-polarized characteristics to a gradually increased polarization in the low-voltage range. Therefore, it is understood the device exhibits a certain phase transition from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic phase. The polarization decreases after a long time of recovery, suggesting it returns to a state close to the initial state. Accordingly, under DC stress, the dielectric constant of the device gradually decreases, and after recovery, it gradually returns to a k value close to the initial state.

Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, has been found to be upregulated in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, chronic pain, and migraines. However, quantitatively monitoring glutamate release in situ has been challenging.

386,EDTM25-000591,An energy-efficient microwave magnetic field generator for NV center quantum magnetometers based on an array of four injection-locked VCOs,"This paper proposes the use of chip-integrated LC voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) as the B1 field source in NV diamond-based magnetometers. VCOs provide a compact, energy-efficient solution by directly converting DC power into the microwave B1 field required for NV center control, bypassing conventional RF amplification stages. Additionally, the VCO’s intrinsic frequency agility, enabled by the varactor inside the LC tank, which simultaneously changes the resonant frequency of the LC resonator and the oscillation frequency, ensures a near-constant B1 field across the tuning range. Current state-of-the-art chip-integrated diamond magnetometers, while showing promising results, typically make use of classical transmitter architectures, in general, providing a lower energy efficiency compared to the presented VCO-based approach. With its very good energy efficiency, the proposed VCO-based approach offers a path to scalable, low-power NV-based magnetometers suitable for portable and embedded applications. To provide a sufficiently large active area for typical diamond samples, the presented VCO-based $B_1$ generator uses an array of four injection-locked VCOs. An on-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) precisely defines the frequency of the B1 field from an external reference.

391,EDTM25-000596,Innovation of BEOL Technology for New IMD Low-k Film,"The pitch scaling of the logic Back-End of the Line (BEOL) module is deteriorating capacitance of interconnect, which is one of the key factor of performance. Therefore, a number of researches are in progress to improve capacitance performance by lowering effective k-value of inter-metal dielectric (IMD) materials. For conventional IMD materials such as low-k (LK) and ultra low-k (ULK), those are vulnerable to the plasma induced damage (PID) during BEOL integration. As a consequence, an effective k-value of IMD must be deteriorated easily, which leads to serious performance degradation. In this paper, we developed high density low-k (HDLK) materials with higher PID resistance by using a new type of precursor, which is capable of generating bridged-carbon bonding (Si-C-Si). We achieved the 30% reduction of PID with HDLK compared to the conventional IMD. As a result, it resulted in the improvement of the BEOL interconnect capacitance by 3%. Throughout these results, we applied HDLK as a basic IMD material in narrow pitch layers of BEOL interconnect. In addition, we developed a different type of film with same precursor by tuning process conditions, which is called a high density ultra low-k (HDULK). This film is applicable to wider pitches of interconnect owing to remarkable characteristics such as lower k-value, good process integrity. Even though we utilized various precursors for each IMD materials in the past, HDLK and HDULK can be implemented by using just one single precursor. Thus, it is strongly expected to contribute to cost reduction.","Kang Sub YIM,Jong Min Baek,Hoon Seok Seo,Sungbin Park,Geun Tae Yun,Yeonggil Kim,Deokyoung Jung,Kyeongbeom Park,Jangho Lee","ks.yim@samsung.com,jongmin.baek@samsung.com,hoonseok.seo@samsung.com,sb_91.park@samsung.com,geun.yun@samsung.com,yeonggil.kim@samsung.com,dy0101.jung@samsung.com,kb88.park@samsung.com,jangho77.lee@samsung.com",01 Materials (invited),final_submitted,,EDTM2025_InvitedTalk_YIM2.pdf,0,0,0,0,0,-,-,-,1,0,9,Dr.,Kang Sub,YIM,ks.yim@samsung.com,SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS,"Korea, Republic of",no,no,yes,yes

393,EDTM25-000598,Degradation of the h-BN by defects generation,"Defect generation and evolution in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) play a crucial role in the reliability and performance of electronic devices utilizing this 2D material. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) simulations to investigate three key aspects: the formation of native defects during device fabrication, the degradation process through defect generation, and the impact of defects electrical properties of h-BN. Our findings reveal that nitrogen vacancies are the most common defects in h-BN, with a formation energy of approximately 3.5 eV lower than that of boron vacancies and it has a strong effect on the electrical properties of h-BN. The presence of water molecules during metal deposition significantly reduces the formation energy of both nitrogen and boron vacancies by 4 eV and 5.5 eV respectively, highlighting the importance of high-vacuum fabrication environments. We identify two primary degradation pathways of h-BN: an in-plane and out-of-plane defect propagation compatible with filament formation in resistive switching applications, and a layer-confined defect generation that can lead to increased device variability. These results provide crucial insights for improving the reliability of h-BN-based devices and optimizing their performance in various applications, including memristors and transistors.","Marco A.

Existing commercial and open-source software allow users to carry out materials simulations but lack predictive power to model manufacturing processes with complex thermal history and do not allow users the flexibility to design microstructures and hence functionality tailored to suit their specific needs.

The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process is the most popular approach for all kinds of 2D materials due to its high yield and quality. Nevertheless, the need for high temperature and the relatively long process time within each cycle hinders commercial development in terms of production cost. However, the transfer procedure has become one of the major limitations of the overall performance. In my talk, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) was used to synthesize Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) through a plasma-assisted selenization process of metal oxide (MOx) at a low temperature as as shown in Figure 1. Compared to other CVD processes, ICP facilitates the decomposition of the precursors at lower temperatures. We create the phase/structure-engineered-1T/2H 3D-hierarchical 2D materials derived from the MOx 3D-hierarchical nanostructures through a low-temperature plasma-assisted selenization process with controlled shapes grown by a glancing angle deposition system (GLAD), as shown in Figure 2.  In addition, a plasma-assisted selenization process (PASP) converted monolayer MoS2 to Janus MoSSe was demonstrated.

459,EDTM25-000671,Reconfigurable magnonic devices for spin-wave manipulation on the nanoscale,"Magnonics offers a promising prospect for low-power, wave-based computing. Active control of spin waves is essential for practical realization of magnonic technology. Here we introduce nanoscale magnonic Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators, waveguides, and magnonic crystals (MCs) for low-loss spin-wave guiding and manipulation. These devices are made of an array of ferromagnetic metal (FM) nanostripes patterned on a low-damping yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. In an array of magnonic FP resonators where two edges of each FM stripe act as two sharp magnetic interfaces, propagating spin waves coherently circulate between the two magnetic interfaces of the resonator and interfere destructively to form transmission gaps with the depth down to the background level. Thus-formed gaps, called as FP gaps, can be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states and efficiently tuned over a wide frequency range via the variation of the stripe width, strip number, and film thickness. When the period between FP resonators meets the Bragg condition, the MCs with deep gaps and low-loss minibands are produced. The MC gaps can also be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states. Moreover, these FP and MC gaps are strongly hybridized when approaching each other, resulting in the gap anti-crossing.  In the magnonic waveguide, the downshift of spin-wave dispersion due to the small effective magnetic field in the YIG and FM region enables the guiding of spin-wave propagation along the nanostripe. We report on low-loss spin-wave channeling in straight and curved nanoscopic waveguides, and further demonstrate reversible control of the spin-wave propagation by changing the frequency and magnetic bias field in a hybrid waveguiding structure. Based on these results, spin-wave filter, multiplexer, and beam splitter using low-loss YIG and FM hybrid structures have been proposed.",Huajun Qin,qinhuajun@whu.edu.cn,04 Memory Technologies (invited),final_submitted,"magnonic crystals ,magnonic Fabry-Perot resonators,wave-based computing",IEEE-EDS-QinHuajun-2025.pdf,0,0,0,0,0,-,-,-,0,0,1,Prof.,Huajun,Qin,qinhuajun@whu.edu.cn,Wuhan University,China,no,yes,yes,yes
