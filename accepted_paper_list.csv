0,0,EDTM25-000004,Energy-Efficient Voltage-Induced Self-Regulated Precessional MRAM with Low Write Error Rate <10^−9,"Voltage-controlled precessional MRAM offers a good power-performance-area balance, positioning it as a promising intermediate memory between SRAM, DRAM, and flash. However, its practical implementation is hindered by the need for highly precise timing control of the incoming voltage pulse, making it susceptible to process, temperature, and other variations, compromising its robustness for memory applications. This study proposes voltage-induced self-regulated precessional (VISP) memory to address this issue. By using angular dependence of MTJ’s resistance, energy asymmetry is created so that the precession is self-terminated without external control. The robustness of switching is evaluated using Fokker-Planck simulations, and it was found that write-error rate < 10^-9 can be achieved with a pulse width of ~ 26 nanoseconds, making VISP well-suited for storage-class memory.","Stanislav Sin,Saeroonter Oh",07 Modelling and Simulation,0

3,3,EDTM25-000009,A Novel Mixed Collector Structure IGBT Operating at High Temperature,"This work proposes a novel insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) with a mixed N-region collector (MNC-IGBT). The addition of a thin N-type doped region within the P-type collector serves to effectively reduce the amplification effect of the internal parasitic PNP transistor on the leakage current in the off-state. As a result，MNC-IGBT markedly reduces the leakage current and increases the operational temperature of the device. The simulation results demonstrate that the leakage current of the MNC-IGBT is reduced by 9% and 8%, respectively, at 175°C and 200°C in comparison to conventional CSTBT, while maintaining a higher breakdown voltage even at 215°C. Furthermore, the on-state voltage drop (Von) and switching losses (Eon, Eoff)of MNC-IGBT are close to those of the CSTBT.

12,12,EDTM25-000022,Effect of Top Al2O3 Interlayer Thickness on the Memory Window of FeFETs with TiN/Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/SiOx/Si (MIFIS) Gate Structure,"In this work, we investigate the effect of top Al2O3 interlayer thickness on the memory window (MW) of Si channel ferroelectric field-effect transistors (Si-FeFETs) with TiN/Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/SiOx/Si (MIFIS) gate structure. We find that the MW first increases and then remains almost constant with the increasing thickness of the top Al2O3 interlayer. This phenomenon is attributed to the smaller electric field of the ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 in the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al2O3 interlayer after a program operation, which makes the charges injected from the metal gate trapped at the top Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 interface cannot remain.","Tao Hu,Runhao Han,Xinpei Jia,Jia Yang,Zeqi Chen,Xiaoqing Sun,Junshuai Chai,Hao Xu,Xiaolei Wang,Wenwu Wang,Tianchun Ye","02 Process, Tools, Yield, and Manufacturing",0

In this research, we performed electrical behavior tests on devices with different gate widths, both before and after the application of stress. Post-stress application, the electrical performance of the devices exhibited a significant positive shift. As the stress applied to the gate and drain increases, the amount of charge trapped in the gate dielectric also increases,resulting in more pronounced electrical performance shifts. It is inferred that these phenomena are due to charge trapping in the gate dielectric during prolonged stress application.","Yupeng LU,yanyu Yang,Peng Wang,Jie Luo,yunjiao bao",08 Reliability and testing,0

Finally, the spike-based electronic retina is proposed by connecting an array of artificial spiking photoreceptors with multiple-input floating gate MOS transistors acting as optical nerves. Consequently, the color image is successfully segmented and the edges of objects in the image are clearly extracted through the electronic retina by simulation, thus providing a solid foundation for neuromorphic sensing system.","Chuanyu Han,Shujing Zhao,Shengli Fang,Shi Quan Fan,Weihua Liu,Xin Li,Li Geng",04 Memory Technologies,0

187,188,EDTM25-000281,RRAM-Based Isotropic CNNs with High Robustness and Resource Utilization Rate,"Resistive random-access memory (RRAM)-based compute-in-memory (CIM) systems show great potential for accelerating convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, classical RRAM-based CNNs suffer from performance degradation from weight quantization and device non-idealities, and resource under-utilization due to mismatches between weight matrices and crossbar arrays. In this work, we propose RRAM-based isotropic CNNs that enhance model robustness and improve resource utilization concurrently. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the isotropic CNNs yield up to 3.74% and 12.61% accuracy improvement under quantization and non-idealities, respectively. Moreover, they increase the utilization rate by 5.2-13.4% in typical network architectures. These results make our design a highly robust and efficient RRAM-based CNN solution.","Wenyong Zhou,Yuan Ren,Jiajun Zhou,Ngai Wong,Zhengwu Liu,Chenchen Ding","13 Disruptive Technologies (Metaverse, Neuromorphic Computing, Quantum Computing)",0

199,200,EDTM25-000299,Hardware Virtualization Technology for Multicore Brain-inspired Chip,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, a new type of AI accelerators, known as the Brain-inspired Chip (BIC), has emerged in Non-von Neumann computing environments, such as SpiNNaker, Loihi, TrueNorth and Tianjic. However, contemporary BICs often exhibit low resource utilization due to the imbalance in hardware resource allocation across various models, which is exacerbated by the lack of virtualization support. Although prior efforts have explored (para-) virtualization techniques to share resources of other AI accelerators such as GPU, these attempts have failed to account for key characteristics of BIC such as interconnection between multiple BIC cores and scratchpad-centric memory, leading to suboptimal performance. 
This paper presents vBIC, a comprehensive BIC virtualization solution featuring two key architectural extensions: (1) BIC memory virtualization which reduces TLB misses and table walking times for scratchpad-centric memory access; and (2) BIC interconnection virtualization which establishes a virtual topology among multiple BIC cores. We have implemented a prototype of vBIC on an FPGA platform. Evaluation results show that vBIC maintains end-to-end performance across various AI workloads.

Embedded micro-channel heat sink have attracted much attention because of their high heat dissipation performance. In this paper, a GaN High-Electron-Mobility Transistor (HEMTs) model is established, and the effects of micro-channel geometry parameters (depth, width, spacing) and cooling fluid rate on heat dissipation performance are investigated by COMSOL Multiphysics. The pressure drop across the coolant inlet and outlet needs to be balanced while achieving effective cooling. With this trade-off, an optimal combination of microfluidic channel dimensions was obtained: depth of 200 μm, width of 100 μm, spacing of 80 μm. An increase in the flow rate of the cooling fluid generally corresponds with enhanced heat dissipation capabilities. Again, there is a trade-off between coolant pressure drop and flow rate to achieve high heat dissipation performance. Finally, in conjunction with the optimality conditions obtained from the simulation, the maximum temperature of the device is 135.5 ℃, which is 45.5 ℃ lower than that of the device without embedded microchannel structure. In addition, the effects of different substrates on the temperature of the device are simulated. Embedded microchannels based on diamond substrates maximize the potential of liquid cooling.

The carrier mobility of the TFTs can be significantly improved by adopting homostructure a-IGZO layers with various stoichiometric ratios. This improvement can be attributed to the raised carrier density in indium-rich a-IGZO because more donor-like oxygen vacancies are induced by the content of indium oxide, reducing the source/drain electrode contact resistance. Moreover, multiple channels can be formed in the homostructure, simultaneously contributing to carrier transport.

The first protocol, a successive multi-stage compliance ramp voltage sweep (MSC-RVS), incrementally increases the voltage to the gate breakdown threshold with varying current compliance, allowing a detailed analysis of failure progression in GaN devices. MSC-RVS enables modeling of the physics of failure mechanisms as functions of temperature and voltage through stage-specific electrical and physical failure analysis. The second protocol employs a constant voltage stress (CVS) scheme, applying fixed current compliance while varying voltage levels. CVS testing under different voltage and temperature conditions supports parameter fitting of the physics of failure models, calibration, and subsequent device lifetime predictions (extrapolation). This study, conducted at room temperature, highlights a multimodal failure mechanism within the device, revealing different regions susceptible to degradation. Three primary failure regions were identified: Schottky, Passivation, and PiN, each associated with unique failure modes: (A) Schottky-only breakdown, (B) Schottky with passivation breakdown, and (C) combined Schottky with PiN/passivation breakdown.

231,232,EDTM25-000345,On the Understanding of Temperature Dependence of Flicker Noise in Advanced FinFET Technology,"Temperature Dependence will complicate the noise problem of FinFET devices. Our experiments show that Flicker noise is obviously affected by high temperature, and shows different temperature dependence under different gate bias. That is, at low gate bias, high temperature makes the flicker noise of the device lower than that at room temperature, while at high gate bias, high temperature makes the flicker noise of the device higher than that at room temperature. A new physical-based model is used to analyze the temperature dependence of flicker noise. The decrease of high temperature noise at low bias is mainly affected by the decrease of Hooge parameter, and the increase of high temperature noise at high bias is mainly affected by the access resistance induced noise. This increase in noise due to high temperatures is likely to be more significant in future GAAFET and CFET devices.","Sheng Yang,Shuying Wang,Chenyang Zhang,Yongkang Xue,Pengpeng Ren,Zhigang Ji",08 Reliability and testing,0

VCOs provide a compact, energy-efficient solution by directly converting DC power into the microwave B1 field required for NV center control, bypassing conventional RF amplification stages. Additionally, the VCO’s intrinsic frequency agility, enabled by the varactor inside the LC tank, which simultaneously changes the resonant frequency of the LC resonator and the oscillation frequency, ensures a near-constant B1 field across the tuning range. Current state-of-the-art chip-integrated diamond magnetometers, while showing promising results, typically make use of classical transmitter architectures, in general, providing a lower energy efficiency compared to the presented VCO-based approach. With its very good energy efficiency, the proposed VCO-based approach offers a path to scalable, low-power NV-based magnetometers suitable for portable and embedded applications.

Therefore, a number of researches are in progress to improve capacitance performance by lowering effective k-value of inter-metal dielectric (IMD) materials. For conventional IMD materials such as low-k (LK) and ultra low-k (ULK), those are vulnerable to the plasma induced damage (PID) during BEOL integration. As a consequence, an effective k-value of IMD must be deteriorated easily, which leads to serious performance degradation. In this paper, we developed high density low-k (HDLK) materials with higher PID resistance by using a new type of precursor, which is capable of generating bridged-carbon bonding (Si-C-Si). We achieved the 30% reduction of PID with HDLK compared to the conventional IMD. As a result, it resulted in the improvement of the BEOL interconnect capacitance by 3%. Throughout these results, we applied HDLK as a basic IMD material in narrow pitch layers of BEOL interconnect. In addition, we developed a different type of film with same precursor by tuning process conditions, which is called a high density ultra low-k (HDULK). This film is applicable to wider pitches of interconnect owing to remarkable characteristics such as lower k-value, good process integrity. Even though we utilized various precursors for each IMD materials in the past, HDLK and HDULK can be implemented by using just one single precursor.

This study employs density functional theory (DFT) simulations to investigate three key aspects: the formation of native defects during device fabrication, the degradation process through defect generation, and the impact of defects electrical properties of h-BN. Our findings reveal that nitrogen vacancies are the most common defects in h-BN, with a formation energy of approximately 3.5 eV lower than that of boron vacancies and it has a strong effect on the electrical properties of h-BN.

457,459,EDTM25-000671,Reconfigurable magnonic devices for spin-wave manipulation on the nanoscale,"Magnonics offers a promising prospect for low-power, wave-based computing. Active control of spin waves is essential for practical realization of magnonic technology. Here we introduce nanoscale magnonic Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators, waveguides, and magnonic crystals (MCs) for low-loss spin-wave guiding and manipulation. These devices are made of an array of ferromagnetic metal (FM) nanostripes patterned on a low-damping yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. In an array of magnonic FP resonators where two edges of each FM stripe act as two sharp magnetic interfaces, propagating spin waves coherently circulate between the two magnetic interfaces of the resonator and interfere destructively to form transmission gaps with the depth down to the background level. Thus-formed gaps, called as FP gaps, can be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states and efficiently tuned over a wide frequency range via the variation of the stripe width, strip number, and film thickness. When the period between FP resonators meets the Bragg condition, the MCs with deep gaps and low-loss minibands are produced. The MC gaps can also be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states. Moreover, these FP and MC gaps are strongly hybridized when approaching each other, resulting in the gap anti-crossing.  In the magnonic waveguide, the downshift of spin-wave dispersion due to the small effective magnetic field in the YIG and FM region enables the guiding of spin-wave propagation along the nanostripe. We report on low-loss spin-wave channeling in straight and curved nanoscopic waveguides, and further demonstrate reversible control of the spin-wave propagation by changing the frequency and magnetic bias field in a hybrid waveguiding structure.
