            <div class="abstract">The capacitor-less two-transistor configuration (2T0C) brings further possibility for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) scaling down. Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML MoS2) has a relatively wide band gap and low leakage current, which can be applied to 2T0C cell. In this work, 1-2L MoS2 transistors based 2T0C DRAM cells are fabricated. The threshold voltages (Vth) of MoS2 transistors are modulated via a simple illumination process to make an operation balance between write transistors and read transistors. Moreover, the capacitive coupling effect at the storage-node (SN) could be optimized by a read pulse compensation. Finally, we demonstrate 2T0C DRAM cell based on 1-2L MoS2 with a retention time (tret) of 31.1s and low leakage current below 10-15A/μm, at the hold voltage (Vhold) of 0V.</div></details>

Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) shows an excess atomic percentage of oxygen possibly due to the oxygen-rich interface between Al2O3 and SiO2/Si. High-frequency capacitance-voltage measurement of fabricated metal oxide semiconductor structures in combination with TCAD simulations are used to detect and quantify the negative interface charge, crucial for CSSJ operation.

            <div class="abstract">The pitch scaling of the logic Back-End of the Line (BEOL) module is deteriorating capacitance of interconnect, which is one of the key factor of performance. Therefore, a number of researches are in progress to improve capacitance performance by lowering effective k-value of inter-metal dielectric (IMD) materials. For conventional IMD materials such as low-k (LK) and ultra low-k (ULK), those are vulnerable to the plasma induced damage (PID) during BEOL integration. As a consequence, an effective k-value of IMD must be deteriorated easily, which leads to serious performance degradation. In this paper, we developed high density low-k (HDLK) materials with higher PID resistance by using a new type of precursor, which is capable of generating bridged-carbon bonding (Si-C-Si). We achieved the 30% reduction of PID with HDLK compared to the conventional IMD. As a result, it resulted in the improvement of the BEOL interconnect capacitance by 3%. Throughout these results, we applied HDLK as a basic IMD material in narrow pitch layers of BEOL interconnect. In addition, we developed a different type of film with same precursor by tuning process conditions, which is called a high density ultra low-k (HDULK). This film is applicable to wider pitches of interconnect owing to remarkable characteristics such as lower k-value, good process integrity. Even though we utilized various precursors for each IMD materials in the past, HDLK and HDULK can be implemented by using just one single precursor. Thus, it is strongly expected to contribute to cost reduction.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">2D layered materials, including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) allow the scaling down to atomically thin thicknesses and possess unique physical properties under dimensionality confinement. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process is the most popular approach for all kinds of 2D materials due to its high yield and quality. Nevertheless, the need for high temperature and the relatively long process time within each cycle hinders commercial development in terms of production cost. However, the transfer procedure has become one of the major limitations of the overall performance. In my talk, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) was used to synthesize Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) through a plasma-assisted selenization process of metal oxide (MOx) at a low temperature as as shown in Figure 1. Compared to other CVD processes, ICP facilitates the decomposition of the precursors at lower temperatures. We create the phase/structure-engineered-1T/2H 3D-hierarchical 2D materials derived from the MOx 3D-hierarchical nanostructures through a low-temperature plasma-assisted selenization process with controlled shapes grown by a glancing angle deposition system (GLAD), as shown in Figure 2.  In addition, a plasma-assisted selenization process (PASP) converted monolayer MoS2 to Janus MoSSe was demonstrated. Various spectroscopies, microscopies, and electrical characterizations were conducted to systematically investigate the MoSSe samples that were synthesized at various temperatures.The applications, including (1) water splitting, (2) gas sensors, (3) batteries, and (4) resistive change memory, will be reported.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Van der Waals (vdW) contacts have been used to show efficient charge injection and collection. Here we demonstrate vdW interface between high k dielectric ZrO2 and atomically thin semiconductors. The ultra-clean interface allows modulation of threshold voltage (Vth) at EOT of < 1nm. In contrast, defective interface between HfO2 does not allow for modulation of Vth.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Gallium oxide is a representative of the fourth-generation semiconductor. The silicon doping of gallium oxide plays a crucial role in optimizing performance, with PEALD as a viable deposition technique due to the advantages of high coverage and precise composition control. In this study, various compositions of amorphous Si-doped gallium oxide thin films were first deposited via PEALD with systematic characterizations. Subsequently, the electrical and optical characterizations were performed incorporating subcycle ratio and Si concentration analysis, paving the way for dielectric and optoelectronic applications of the amorphous Si-GaOx thin film.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">The Angstrom era demands breakthroughs in materials and device architectures as silicon scaling reaches its limits. This study explores 2D materials like MoS2 and WSe2, highlighting advances in wafer-scale growth, adhesion engineering, and interconnect innovation. Pulsed CVD achieves uniform monolayers, as well as adhesion lithography enables high-resolution patterning with improved contact resistance. Nanocrystalline graphene and a-BN address interconnect challenges with diffusion barrier properties and ultralow-k dielectric performance. These advancements provide a roadmap for next-generation electronics.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">This work introduces a solution-processed approach for growing Cs₂PbX₄ nanostructures on CsPbI₂Br thin films, achieving effective control over interface morphology. The surface of CsPbI₂Br thin films is modified through CsCl post-treatment using various organic solvents. Careful optimization of post-treatment parameters, including solvent selection and processing conditions, ensures uniform nanostructure growth and improved interfacial properties. This strategy significantly reduces defects and enhances charge transport, leading to efficient and stable Cs-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs).</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Two-dimensional materials show promise for resistive switching devices as building blocks for neuromorphic computing. We explore MoS₂ in different device configurations utilizing ion transport along van der Waals gaps, revealing reduced variability and high yields. We demonstrate volatile switching in vertical bilayer stacks of SiOx and MoS2. We also show lateral MoS2 devices with ultra-low threshold voltages. Temperature-dependent current-voltage data on h-BN memristors elucidate conduction mechanisms for a deeper understanding of the resistive switching mechanism.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Nonvolatile phase-change memory (PCM), which utilizes rapid and reversible electrothermal-induced phase transitions, is emerging as a key candidate for storage class memory to close the access-time gap between conventional memory and storage in computer systems. In this talk an alternative view on the phase transition mechanism of phase change memory will be proposed, starting from the octahedral structure motifs. Based on this mechanism, high performance phase change materials are developed for storage-class memory and embedded data storage applications.</div></details>
