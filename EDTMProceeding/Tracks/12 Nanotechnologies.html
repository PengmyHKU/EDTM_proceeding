            <div class="abstract">Data-driven learning methods have great potential in optimizing memristive devices, yet its application in memristor inverse modeling is still facing big challenge due to the scarcity of experimental data and device randomness. Here, we proposes a novel data preprocessing method including data generation, data augmentation and statistical preprocessing. With the aid of above techniques, we manage to achieve less than 5% relative errors in the test regression problem just need a few original I-V curves. Comparing with relevant studies, this work just needs a few of original experimental or simulated I-V curves which is achievable under laboratory conditions.</div></details>

Apart from the unique features of FeD, including high non-linearity, multi-conductive states and non-volatility, “data line” and “coding line” configurations are implemented, where data line takes care of both search line and match line functions over the traditional CAM structure, and coding line is used to enhance the expansion of match window. The designed ACAM achieves a high bit density (up to 5 bit/cell) parallel search with minimal overlap between match windows and the smallest footprint known (~ 0.12 μm2/cell for 45 nm node).</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">The shortest path problem is a cornerstone in graph theory, with traditional algorithms often incurring a computational complexity of O(n2). In recent years, Ag nanowire memristor networks have emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation hardware due to their excellent random full-interconnectivity and memristive properties. This work introduces a novel approach to implement the shortest path problem using Ag nanowire network hardware, which significantly reduces the computational complexity from O(n2) to O(1), thereby enhancing computational efficiency dramatically. Our method not only offers a substantial improvement in performance but also paves the way for future algorithmic deployment on nanowire networks.

However, the performance of the back-to-back photodiodes still requires improvement.

By considering two tunneling regions at the source and showing how these regions vary with the gate and drain voltages, a compact model that captures even the non-linear dependence of the drain current at low drain voltages observed in fabricated devices is developed. The proposed model reproduces the results from TCAD simulations and published experimental data with close agreement. This highlights the importance of incorporating the gate- and drain-dependent source tunneling barriers in modeling 2-D FETs.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Deterministic growth of a single-phase material with a low defect density is essential for achieving phase-sensitive properties uniformly and on demand in a scalable manner. While layered materials exhibit various polytypes with significantly different crystal symmetries and properties, the small difference in free energies between polytypes makes phase control challenging [1]. Here, we report the deterministic growth of bilayer MoS2 films with a hexagonal single phase over a large area using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. In layer-by-layer growth, forming single Mo atom seeds on top of the first-grown MoS2 layer prior to the second-layer growth ensures deterministic stacking of the second layer. Density functional theory suggests that these atomic seeds serve as nucleation sites, guiding the crystal growth of the hexagonal phase and preventing the formation of the rhombohedral phase. </div></details>
