The sensors fabricated in the same batch exhibited good device-to-device uniformity. A calibration-free approach was developed based on early transient response characteristics of a small number of device samples. The obtained model was then implemented in a mobile phone to build a mobile sensing system. Fast and accurate detection was demonstrated by applying the system to other fresh gas sensors in the same batch without calibration. </div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Engineering robust solid-state quantum systems is amongst the most pressing challenges to realize scalable quantum photonic circuitry. While several 3D systems (such as diamond or gallium arsenid) have been thoroughly studied, solid state emitters in two dimensional (2D) materials are still in their infancy.  In this presentation I will discuss the appeal of an emerging van der Waals crystal – hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This unique system possesses a large bandgap of ~ 6 eV and can host single defects that can act as ultra-bright quantum light sources. In addition, some of these defects exhibit spin dependent fluorescence that can be initialised and coherently manipulated. I will discuss in details various methodologies to engineer these defects and show their peculiar properties. Furthermore, I will discuss how hBN crystals can be carefully sculpted into nanoscale photonic resonators to confine and guide light at the nanoscale. Taking advantage of the unique 2D nature of hBN, I will also show promising avenues to integrate hBN emitters with silicon nitride photonic crystal cavities. All in all, hBN possesses all the vital constituents to become the leading platform for integrated quantum photonics. To this extent, I will highlight the challenges and opportunities in engineering hBN quantum photonic devices and will frame it more broadly in the growing interest with 2D materials nanophotonics.   </div></details>

            <div class="abstract">This paper proposes the use of chip-integrated LC voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) as the B1 field source in NV diamond-based magnetometers. VCOs provide a compact, energy-efficient solution by directly converting DC power into the microwave B1 field required for NV center control, bypassing conventional RF amplification stages. Additionally, the VCO’s intrinsic frequency agility, enabled by the varactor inside the LC tank, which simultaneously changes the resonant frequency of the LC resonator and the oscillation frequency, ensures a near-constant B1 field across the tuning range. Current state-of-the-art chip-integrated diamond magnetometers, while showing promising results, typically make use of classical transmitter architectures, in general, providing a lower energy efficiency compared to the presented VCO-based approach. With its very good energy efficiency, the proposed VCO-based approach offers a path to scalable, low-power NV-based magnetometers suitable for portable and embedded applications. To provide a sufficiently large active area for typical diamond samples, the presented VCO-based $B_1$ generator uses an array of four injection-locked VCOs. An on-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) precisely defines the frequency of the B1 field from an external reference. The design is validated using electrical measurements that reflect the key metrics of the target quantum magnetometry application.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Bioelectronics encompassing electronic components and circuits for accessing human information play a vital role in real-time and continuous monitoring of biophysiological signals of electrophysiology, mechanical physiology, and electrochemical physiology. However, mechanical noise, particularly motion artifacts, poses a significant challenge in accurately detecting and analyzing target signals. While software-based “postprocessing” methods and signal filtering techniques have been widely employed, challenges such as signal distortion, major requirement of accurate models for classification, power consumption, and data delay inevitably persist. This review presents an overview of noise reduction strategies in bioelectronics, focusing on reducing motion artifacts and improving the signal-to-noise ratio through hardware-based approaches such as “preprocessing”. One of the main stress-avoiding strategies is reducing elastic mechanical energies applied to bioelectronics to prevent stress-induced motion artifacts. [1] Various approaches including strain-compliance, strain-resistance, and stress-damping techniques using unique materials and structures have been explored. Future research should optimize materials and structure designs, establish stable processes and measurement methods, and develop techniques for selectively separating and processing overlapping noises. Ultimately, these advancements will contribute to the development of more reliable and effective bioelectronics for healthcare monitoring and diagnostics.</div></details>
