            <div class="abstract">As the realization of a series of high-performance lithium niobate (LN) photonic integrated devices, LN has become one of the most promising platforms for photonic integrated circuits. While the highly compatible LN based on chip light sources are still lacking. It is an urgent need to develop C-band light source on LN chips. We theoretically studied an erbium-doped Al2O3 waveguide laser based on distributed feedback (DFB) cavity in the thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform. By utilizing chalcogenide glass (CHG) as the cladding material in a sandwich structure, a high confinement factor (52.5%) and laser power is attained. The Laser is pumped at 1480 nm and exhibit fundamental TE mode at 1533 nm, with lasers yield efficiencies up to 27.1% and lasering threshold as low as 4.4 mW in a 10-mm-long DFB cavity.</div>

Furthermore, the device exploits a photo-induced ferroelectric polarization reversal mechanism, resulting in a non-volatile light response that persists for over 10^3 s, accompanied with an impressive photoresponsivity of up to 10^5 A/W in the broad-spectrum range of 400-980 nm.

            <div class="abstract">In 2D layered systems, converting excessive photoexcited energy into an electrical response before losing it to the substrate is crucial for energy-efficient photodetection. These hot electron energy losses at photoemission junctions limit the carrier transfer, sensitivity, and modulation frequencies. Our study showcases improved photoresponse in macroscopic assembled graphene (MAG)/Si Schottky junctions by inserting a graphene (Gr) layer that electronically decouples MAG from Si. This van der Waals (vdW) engineering interface effectively suppresses dark current while maintaining hot carrier re-thermalization in the MAG film, leading to enhanced photo thermionic emission (PTI). This vdW interfacial engineering technique has broader implications in energy-efficient electronics, optoelectronics, and memory devices. </div>

            <div class="abstract">This work presents a novel active pixel sensor (APS) design for soft X-ray flat panel detectors (FPDs) intended for non-destructive testing (NDT) applications that require high sensitivity, a wide dynamic range, and fast imaging capabilities. Unlike conventional passive pixel sensor (PPS), this design employs dual-gate thin film transistor (TFT) operating in the subthreshold region to compress and amplify optical signals, thereby expanding both detection limit and range. The array features randomly-accessible capabilities, achieving a frame rate of 88fps, making it as a promising candidate for real-time in-line inspection applications.</div>

            <div class="abstract">Optical fiber acoustic sensors have attracted remarkable attention in the detection of weak acoustic signals. To achieve both small size and high sensitivity, we present a sub-millimeter-scale optical fiber acoustic sensor based on a 3D Fabry–Pérot (FP) interferometer with ortho-planar springs. The design of ortho-planar springs can not only effectively enhance mechanical sensitivity but also reduce the total size of the sensor head. Experimental results demonstrate that its noise equivalent pressure of the fabricated sensor is 49.32 μPa/√Hz around 2 kHz and the mechanical quality factor of its fundamental vibration resonance is around 31.</div>

            <div class="abstract">Spectrally selective photodetectors that can eliminate noise from undesired wavelengths are essential for many applications. Traditional approaches often combine broadband photodetectors with filters, resulting in increased structural complexity and higher production costs. Here, we present a filter-free visible-blind photodetector that demonstrates selective photoresponse in the near-infrared range. We investigate the underlying mechanisms of the resonant absorption effect and the photogating effect to elucidate the visible-blind photoresponse. The proposed design offers a simplified method for achieving tunable light detection with high stability and low fabrication complexity.</div>

The modulation of Schottky barrier caused by vacancy migration in the devices results in a tunable, non-volatile photoresponse, which can be used to build neuromorphic hardware for intelligent perception as demonstrated. Furthermore, scaling the neuromorphic hardware to larger dimensions is conceptually feasible due to the simple device structure and provides various training possibilities for neuromorphic vision applications.</div>

            <div class="abstract">Infrared photodetectors has seen significant advancements with the utilization of traditional thin-film semiconductors (InGaAs, InSb, HgCdTe, and QWIP) and novel type-II superlattice structures, offering highly sensitive detection capabilities. However, the inherent drawbacks of requiring low-temperature environments and discrete architectures for sensing, memory, and computing have resulted in expensive and bulky systems. In the past decade, the emergence of two-dimensional (2D) materials has revolutionized the field due to their intriguing electrical and optical characteristics. By mitigating dark current and enabling reconfigurable multi-state functionality via localized field control, the longstanding challenges associated with bulky and discrete architectures can potentially be surmounted. Meanwhile, the ultra-thin nature and stretchable properties offer unprecedented opportunities for the development of smart photodetectors with lightweight and deformability, resembling retina-like nano-devices.</div>
