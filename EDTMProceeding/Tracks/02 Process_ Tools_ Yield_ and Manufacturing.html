            <div class="abstract">In this work, we investigate the effect of top Al2O3 interlayer thickness on the memory window (MW) of Si channel ferroelectric field-effect transistors (Si-FeFETs) with TiN/Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/SiOx/Si (MIFIS) gate structure. We find that the MW first increases and then remains almost constant with the increasing thickness of the top Al2O3 interlayer. This phenomenon is attributed to the smaller electric field of the ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 in the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al2O3 interlayer after a program operation, which makes the charges injected from the metal gate trapped at the top Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 interface cannot remain.</div>

The C-ln(f) method is verified and modified based on the simulation results of the distributed bulk-oxide trap model. The MIFM capacitors were fabricated with different interlayers (HfO2 or ZrO2) between the HZO and top TiN electrode. It is found that the devices with HfO2 or ZrO2 interlayer have lower border trap density after wake-up cycling, demonstrating the potential for reliability improvement.</div>

We find that after the erase operation, the increased hole density trapped at the SiOx/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 interface and decreased ferroelectric polarization, are key factors leading to the degradation of the threshold voltage after the erase operation (Vth_ERS) for the FeFETs with MIFIS structure.

            <div class="abstract">In this work, passivation effect on ALD IGZO transistors was studied by characterizing the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). IGZO devices without passivation, with H2O-growth Ga2O3 passivation and O3-growth SiO2 passivation were fabricated and characterized to compare the passivation effect. It is found that H2O-growth Ga2O3 introduces a large amount of oxygen vacancies (VO) and degrades IGZO device performance dramatically. While O3-growth SiO2 passivation has much less damage on IGZO and shows decent performance. However, devices with O3-growth SiO2 passivation still show degraded PBTI performance compared with devices without passivation, suggesting fast trap generation still exists due to the growth of SiO2 passivation.</div>

The iso-leakage frequency degrades up to 2.20% with layout misalignment of 4 nm. It’s found that the Drain Merge resistance degrades significantly with misalignment increasing and is identified as the major variation source.  Through careful DTCO with design rule optimization, the variation can be greatly suppressed, while the resistance fluctuation of the DM also drops substantially. Monte Carlo random experiments were also conducted, validating the variation reduction. Comparing with the CFET featuring self-aligned gate and much less overlay induced misalignment,  fortunately, FFET’s PP is still better except when misalignment reaches 8 nm, which is out of spec and nearly  impossible.

The 0.5 µm devices exhibit a maximum drain current density (Idmax) of 680 mA/mm, a peak transconductance (Gmax) of 230 mS/mm, and small-signal characteristics with a cutoff frequency (fT) and maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) of 19 GHz and 28 GHz, respectively. Continuous wave (CW) loadpull measurements at 3.6 GHz demonstrate an output power density of 3.1 W/mm, a peak power added efficiency (PAE) of 43.5%, and a linear gain of 20 dB. The 0.25 µm devices show a maximum drain current density (Imax) of 979 mA/mm, a peak transconductance (Gmax) of 286 mS/mm, and small-signal characteristics with a cutoff frequency (fT) and maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) of 34 GHz and 50 GHz, respectively. CW loadpull measurements at 10 GHz yield an output power density of 2.71 W/mm, a peak power added efficiency (PAE) of 44.5%, and a linear gain of 12 dB. The low and uniform ohmic contact resistance (Rc) of 0.2-0.3 Ω·mm across the wafer indicates the potential for high-performance and cost-effective 6-inch GaN with silicon CMOS compatibility for RF applications.</div>

            <div class="abstract">Oxide-based memory devices are promising candidates for  future non-volatile resistive random-access memories  (RRAMs). However, these devices typically exhibit digital  resistive switching behavior, which constrains their  applicability in neuromorphic computing. In this article, we  demonstrate that the insertion of an ultra-thin by ALD Al₂O₃ layer prior to a TiN/HZO/W memristor facilitates a transition  from digital to analog switching characteristics. The device  exhibits good durability (104 %) and excellent retention  (>3000s) across multiple resistance states. Through an  analysis of the device's interface chemical state and fitting of  the I-V curve, we observe that the oxygen within the Al₂O₃ layer undergoes gradual oxidation and reduction, avoiding  the abrupt formation and rupture of conductive filaments.  This work provides valuable insights for the modification and  optimization of oxide memristors.  </div>

            <div class="abstract">In high-reliability MOS circuit applications, SOI devices demonstrate outstanding performance. However, traditional SOI structures utilizing SiO2 as the buried layer face challenges due to the poor thermal conductivity and low melting ponits of SiO2, leading to high temperature thermal instability. To address this issue, we insert Al2O3 interlayer in high vacuum surface activated bonding(SAB) process.The Al2O3 interlayer in bonding interface increases the bonding energy from 2.9 J/m² to 3.24 J/m². Notably, the bonding interface remains stable and robust even after annealing at 1100℃. Moerover, the presence of the Al2O3 interlayer creates a potential barrier at the bonding interface, which reduces the vertical leakage of the device.</div>

            <div class="abstract">In this work, we studied the effect of DC stress at room temperature on the polarization strength and dielectric constant of HfxZr1-xO2 film capacitors, as well as the retention of this effect. We found that under DC stress, the device changes from a significant non-polarized characteristics to a gradually increased polarization in the low-voltage range. Therefore, it is understood the device exhibits a certain phase transition from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic phase. The polarization decreases after a long time of recovery, suggesting it returns to a state close to the initial state. Accordingly, under DC stress, the dielectric constant of the device gradually decreases, and after recovery, it gradually returns to a k value close to the initial state. The above results suggest the correlation between k value and crystal phases during reliability testing.</div>

            <div class="abstract">The creation of artificial neural systems that replicate human skin’s tactile perception capabilities has transformative potential for applications like prosthetics, virtual reality, and smart sensing. Current systems often integrate pressure sensors, memory units, and signal processing circuits to emulate sensory neurons. However, challenges remain in achieving miniaturization, high-density integration, and optimal performance due to reliance on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). This study introduces a monolithic, three-dimensional (3D) integrated artificial neural system based on ferroelectric HfxZr1-xO2. Utilizing the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) state of hafnia films, positioned between orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, the system achieves high piezoelectric performance, critical for sensing. The MPB-based sensor is seamlessly integrated with a self-rectifying ferroelectric tunnel junction memory and silicon-based signal processors. Experimental results demonstrate pressure sensing capabilities over a 1–50 kPa range with a sensitivity of 0.35 mV/kPa. The system also exhibits real-time frequency modulation via precise tuning of hafnia's functional properties, offering significant advancements in miniaturized and CMOS-compatible artificial sensory technologies.</div>
