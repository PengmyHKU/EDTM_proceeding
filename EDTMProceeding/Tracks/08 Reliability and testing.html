            <div class="abstract">In this work, the effect of oxide quality in the self-aligned block (SAB) region of n-LDMOS with contact field plate on hot carrier degradation (HCD) is investigated. Experiments and simulations confirm that the degradation of ID and Rsp in on-state HCD is less than that in off-state HCD due to the capture competition mechanism between electrons and holes. This trapping mechanism is inhibited when the combination process is used to form high-quality oxides in the SAB region, improving HCD.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">In this work, we compare the variation between planar MOSFETs and FinFET and extract band tail states using a physical model for comparison. The results clearly show that the threshold voltage (Vth) and subthreshold swing (SS) variations of both planar MOSFETs and FinFET increase as temperature decreases and as device size shrinks. However, a comparison of device variability reveals that FinFET exhibits greater variability in both Vth and SS at cryogenic temperature. Furthermore, the extracted band tail states parameters indicate that FinFET exhibits more band tail states, this may be the reason for the larger variation. Our comparison demonstrates that FinFET experience higher variability than planar MOSFETs. This suggests that designing devices for advanced process nodes at cryogenic temperature demands greater attention to device variations to prevent device failure.</div></details>

In this research, we performed electrical behavior tests on devices with different gate widths, both before and after the application of stress. Post-stress application, the electrical performance of the devices exhibited a significant positive shift. As the stress applied to the gate and drain increases, the amount of charge trapped in the gate dielectric also increases,resulting in more pronounced electrical performance shifts. It is inferred that these phenomena are due to charge trapping in the gate dielectric during prolonged stress application.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">The effect of relative humidity (RH) in Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (CAFM) remains unclear due to contradictory findings, limited sample testing, and the lack of current limitations to prevent tip degradation and data inaccuracies. This study investigates the impact of RH on CAFM measurements, addressing reliability concerns due to inconsistent previous findings. Over 17,000 stress tests were conducted across 10 samples with 110-pA current limitation to prevent tip degradation. Results reveal that humidity increases current in insulating and ultra-thin semiconducting samples by enlarging the conductive area via water meniscus formation, while metallic samples remain unaffected. Findings enhance CAFM reliability and offer guidelines for more consistent testing in electronic device analysis.</div></details>

Density functional theory further proves that water residue is the origin of defect formation which weakens bonds. Au/h-BN/Au devices fabricated at 5×10-6 Torr achieve less leakage than those made at 3×10-5 Torr, streamlining 2D material integration in electronics.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Understanding pixel-to-pixel (P-P) variance of dark current and photoresponse from individual pixels in image sensors is crucial to address artifacts, noise, and photoresponse inaccuracies in the overall imaging process. Specifically, well-calibrated pixel-to-pixel variance and specific photoresponse statistics of the raw output data help to identify the unavoidable error contributions from individual pixels, thus enabling compensation through computational image processing or readout circuits. This is particularly vital for emerging image sensors based on 2D materials integrated with silicon, which often utilize readout circuits distinct from traditional CCD and CMOS sensors. This work investigates pixel-to-pixel variance in graphene-silicon Schottky photodiodes, assessing the feasibility of large-scale fabrication, uniformity of dark current, and photoresponse in small-scale arrays. The array-based pixel statistics investigated in this study have potential implications for designing in-sensor processing and developing accurate statistical estimation methods for imaging in astronomy, biomedical, and spectroscopy.</div></details>

            <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
            <div class="abstract">This study proposes an enhanced reliability testing framework for GaN transistors, utilizing two distinct reliability test protocols. The first protocol, a successive multi-stage compliance ramp voltage sweep (MSC-RVS), incrementally increases the voltage to the gate breakdown threshold with varying current compliance, allowing a detailed analysis of failure progression in GaN devices. MSC-RVS enables modeling of the physics of failure mechanisms as functions of temperature and voltage through stage-specific electrical and physical failure analysis. The second protocol employs a constant voltage stress (CVS) scheme, applying fixed current compliance while varying voltage levels. CVS testing under different voltage and temperature conditions supports parameter fitting of the physics of failure models, calibration, and subsequent device lifetime predictions (extrapolation). This study, conducted at room temperature, highlights a multimodal failure mechanism within the device, revealing different regions susceptible to degradation. Three primary failure regions were identified: Schottky, Passivation, and PiN, each associated with unique failure modes: (A) Schottky-only breakdown, (B) Schottky with passivation breakdown, and (C) combined Schottky with PiN/passivation breakdown. The findings provide valuable insights into the multimodal failure pathways in p-GaN gate HEMTs, advancing the understanding of their reliability under varied stress conditions.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Temperature Dependence will complicate the noise problem of FinFET devices. Our experiments show that Flicker noise is obviously affected by high temperature, and shows different temperature dependence under different gate bias. That is, at low gate bias, high temperature makes the flicker noise of the device lower than that at room temperature, while at high gate bias, high temperature makes the flicker noise of the device higher than that at room temperature. A new physical-based model is used to analyze the temperature dependence of flicker noise. The decrease of high temperature noise at low bias is mainly affected by the decrease of Hooge parameter, and the increase of high temperature noise at high bias is mainly affected by the access resistance induced noise. This increase in noise due to high temperatures is likely to be more significant in future GAAFET and CFET devices.</div></details>

Towards the integration of RRAM arrays, the sneak path leakage and IR drop problem need to be alleviated and the memory density should be further enhanced. Here we develop the consistent RRAM model, demonstrate two-dimensional (2D) selectors and one-selector-one-selector (1S1R) memory cells, perform monolithic 3D integration of 2D transistors and vertical RRAMs (VRRAMs), and show the promise for in-memory search applications. </div></details>

            <div class="abstract">MXenes, a member of the two-dimensional (2D) materials family, are of interest in the field of flexible electronics because of their unique mechanical, physical and chemical properties. However, the challenges of large-area preparation of MXene films have limited their development in the fields of wearable electronics. In this work, we used a surface modification method to prepare Janus MXene film with distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties on each surface, and used phase-interface transfer method for preparing large-area and high-quality MXene films. Furthermore, we constructed the Ag/Janus-MXene/ITO/PET flexible memristors. The results show that a stable unipolar and bipolar resistive switching (RS) with low switching voltages (~0.27 V), high mechanical endurance (> 200 cycles), and long retention time (~2900 s). In addition, we have successfully simulated several typical synaptic behaviors, such as spike-amplitude-dependent Plasticity (SADP) and spike-number-dependent plasticity (SNDP), demonstrating its potential in the field of neuromorphic computing.</div></details>

Based on 40nm foundry PDK, the implemented sampling circuit enhances recognition accuracy by 16% at 125°C. Meanwhile, the zoom window switch scheme achieves an 93% reduction in average capacitor switching energy compared to traditional methods.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Defect generation and evolution in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) play a crucial role in the reliability and performance of electronic devices utilizing this 2D material. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) simulations to investigate three key aspects: the formation of native defects during device fabrication, the degradation process through defect generation, and the impact of defects electrical properties of h-BN. Our findings reveal that nitrogen vacancies are the most common defects in h-BN, with a formation energy of approximately 3.5 eV lower than that of boron vacancies and it has a strong effect on the electrical properties of h-BN. The presence of water molecules during metal deposition significantly reduces the formation energy of both nitrogen and boron vacancies by 4 eV and 5.5 eV respectively, highlighting the importance of high-vacuum fabrication environments. We identify two primary degradation pathways of h-BN: an in-plane and out-of-plane defect propagation compatible with filament formation in resistive switching applications, and a layer-confined defect generation that can lead to increased device variability. These results provide crucial insights for improving the reliability of h-BN-based devices and optimizing their performance in various applications, including memristors and transistors.</div></details>
