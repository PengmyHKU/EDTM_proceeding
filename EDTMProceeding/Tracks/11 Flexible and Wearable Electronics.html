            <div class="abstract">In flexible and stretchable electronic devices, as well as in highly integrated and miniaturized high-performance electronic products, thermal interface materials (TIMs) play an important role in maintaining. However, widely used flexible polymers such as PI and PDMS have inherently poor thermal conductivity, leading to issues with heat dissipation. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to enhance thermal conductivity by creating polymer composites using materials such as carbon, metals, and ceramics. Among these materials, hexagonal boron nitride(h-BN) stands out as an excellent candidate for TIMs due to its high thermal conductivity, superior insulation, and excellent chemical stability. However, h-BN exhibits high in-plane thermal conductivity (600 W/m-1K-1) and relatively low through-plane thermal conductivity (30 W/m-1K-1). Consequently, recent research has focused on improving the vertical thermal conductivity of composites containing h-BN.
In this study, a film capable of anisotropic dissipation was produced through a tetrahedral structure using BN nanosheets. The film includes flexibility and elasticity without degrading thermal conductivity during deformation and improves vertical thermal conductivity. In addition, this film effectively reduced the heat generated by the LED. This study shows the possibility of TIM for cooling integrated and miniaturized high-performance electronic devices, and suggests the possibility of satisfying the need to develop flexible and flexible electronic devices.</div></details>

            <div class="abstract">Chemical biomarkers in the central nervous system can provide valuable quantitative measures to gain insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, has been found to be upregulated in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, chronic pain, and migraines. However, quantitatively monitoring glutamate release in situ has been challenging. This work presents a novel class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting sensors, with dimensions as low as 50 by 50 µm2, can detect real-time changes in glutamate within the biologically relevant concentration range. Experiments exploiting the hippocampal circuit in mice models demonstrate the capability of the sensors in monitoring glutamate release via electrical stimulation using acute brain slices.  These advances could aid in basic neuroscience studies and translational engineering, as the sensors provide a diagnostic tool for neurological disorders. Additionally, adapting the biofuel cell design to other neurotransmitters can potentially enable the detailed study of the effect of neurotransmitter dysregulation on neuronal cell signaling pathways and revolutionize neuroscience.</div></details>
