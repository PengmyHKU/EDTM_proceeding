            <div class="authors">Stanislav Sin,Saeroonter Oh</div>
            <div class="abstract">Voltage-controlled precessional MRAM offers a good power-performance-area balance, positioning it as a promising intermediate memory between SRAM, DRAM, and flash. However, its practical implementation is hindered by the need for highly precise timing control of the incoming voltage pulse, making it susceptible to process, temperature, and other variations, compromising its robustness for memory applications. This study proposes voltage-induced self-regulated precessional (VISP) memory to address this issue. By using angular dependence of MTJ’s resistance, energy asymmetry is created so that the precession is self-terminated without external control. The robustness of switching is evaluated using Fokker-Planck simulations, and it was found that write-error rate < 10^-9 can be achieved with a pulse width of ~ 26 nanoseconds, making VISP well-suited for storage-class memory.</div>

            <div class="abstract">Recent advances have enabled single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) to be fully integrated with CMOS signal conditioning and processing circuits, paving the way for compact and efficient imaging applications. However, a significant challenge remains: the absence of accurate models for optimizing the SPAD design prior to fabrication. In this paper, we present a comprehensive noise model and compare simulation results with experimental measurements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness and the necessity of robust SPAD modeling for design optimization as a critical step before fabrication.</div>

            <div class="abstract">This work proposes a novel insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) with a mixed N-region collector (MNC-IGBT). The addition of a thin N-type doped region within the P-type collector serves to effectively reduce the amplification effect of the internal parasitic PNP transistor on the leakage current in the off-state. As a result，MNC-IGBT markedly reduces the leakage current and increases the operational temperature of the device. The simulation results demonstrate that the leakage current of the MNC-IGBT is reduced by 9% and 8%, respectively, at 175°C and 200°C in comparison to conventional CSTBT, while maintaining a higher breakdown voltage even at 215°C. Furthermore, the on-state voltage drop (Von) and switching losses (Eon, Eoff)of MNC-IGBT are close to those of the CSTBT. The excellent performance of MNC-IGBT provides a reliable solution for increasing the operating temperature of IGBTs.</div>

            <div class="abstract">This paper presents an enhanced compact model for describing the time dynamics of GIDL-assisted erase in MONOS 3D NAND flash strings. Compare to previous models, our approach accounts for both electron back-tunneling from metal gate and electron emission from CTN under high electric fields. While increasing the thickness of BOX reduces electron back tunneling, it also slows the erase transient speed. An increase in the gate work function (WF) can suppress back tunneling and delay saturation, thereby improving the overall erase characteristics.</div>

In the literature, an area and energy-efficient circuit based on band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) using partially depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (PDSOI) MOSFETs with standard SOI technology has been proposed. However, PD-SOI technology is costly due to the expensive “smart-cut” method to fabricate SOI wafers. Therefore, in this work, we propose a bulk MOSFET design with separate body contact and laminated well technique to enable BTBT's current collection. This is followed by the implementation of a Leaky integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron using mixed-mode simulation in TCAD with a well-calibrated deck to demonstrate spiking neuron.

            <div class="abstract">As the power density of Gallium Nitride (GaN)-based devices increases, heat dissipation becomes a major challenge. Embedded micro-channel heat sink have attracted much attention because of their high heat dissipation performance. In this paper, a GaN High-Electron-Mobility Transistor (HEMTs) model is established, and the effects of micro-channel geometry parameters (depth, width, spacing) and cooling fluid rate on heat dissipation performance are investigated by COMSOL Multiphysics. The pressure drop across the coolant inlet and outlet needs to be balanced while achieving effective cooling. With this trade-off, an optimal combination of microfluidic channel dimensions was obtained: depth of 200 μm, width of 100 μm, spacing of 80 μm. An increase in the flow rate of the cooling fluid generally corresponds with enhanced heat dissipation capabilities. Again, there is a trade-off between coolant pressure drop and flow rate to achieve high heat dissipation performance. Finally, in conjunction with the optimality conditions obtained from the simulation, the maximum temperature of the device is 135.5 ℃, which is 45.5 ℃ lower than that of the device without embedded microchannel structure. In addition, the effects of different substrates on the temperature of the device are simulated. Embedded microchannels based on diamond substrates maximize the potential of liquid cooling. This paper provides theoretical and experimental basis for the design and optimization of embedded microchannel cooling structure, which is helpful to improve the heat dissipation performance of GaN devices.</div>

            <div class="authors">Yusi Zhao,Huawei Tang,Rongzheng Ding,Yudong Lv,Yanbo Tang,Shaofeng Yu</div>
            <div class="abstract">This work investigates the effects of uniaxial stress on the performance of ultra-scaled gate-all-around field-effect transistors (GAAFETs) through multi-subband Boltzmann transport equation (MSBTE)-based simulations. Both scattering-limited and ballistic on-state saturation currents are calculated to explore the effectiveness of uniaxial stress in enhancing device performance. Although uniaxial stress (within the experimentally achievable range of values) still yields performance gains, the underlying physical mechanisms differ from those observed in previous technology nodes. By extracting key parameters, such as ballistic injection velocity, quantum gate capacitance and backscattering coefficient, we provide fundamental physical insight into the impact of stress in ultra-scaled GAAFETs. </div>

            <div class="authors">Yichen Wen,Shuying Wang,Xiaoman Yang,Hai-Bao Chen,Maokun Wu,Runsheng Wang,Zhigang Ji,Ru Huang</div>
            <div class="abstract">As the critical dimensions of interconnect scaling, the enhancement of surface scattering increases the resistivity, contributing to the reduction in electromigration lifetime. Besides, the enhanced surface scattering can lower surface conductivity, resulting in cross-sectional current crowding and potentially decreasing the interconnect's electromigration resistance. Through finite element simulation, this work demonstrates the appearance of this extra decrement when the positive feedback between the Joule heat and resistivity is enhanced. As the metal's electric and thermal conductivity degrade with scaling, the cross-sectional crowding effect becomes significant, resulting in the electromigration stress increment by 10%, 33%, and 7% for Cu, Co, and Ru compared to the uniform current case at 9 nm thickness. This work reveals a potential influence on EM lifetime at advanced technology nodes and highlights Ru as an alternative interconnect metal that can effectively resist this adverse effect.</div>

However, the floating body effect (FBE) of this structure is not well understood. Its potential to enhance device performance represents a new direction for the future development of 3D DRAM. This study systematically investigates the physical mechanisms of the FBE and the effect of process parameters on the electrical characteristics of the access transistor. The results show that channel length and doping are not sensitive to leakage current, suggesting that the FBE can be leveraged to reduce the cell area, thereby providing design guidelines for high-density 3D DRAM applications.

            <div class="abstract">The sheets/channels are vertically stacked in Nanosheet FET (NSFET), which forms a complex capacitive network. Till date, to the best of our knowledge, the only bias-independent capacitance model for NSFET has been presented by considering that the device is mirrored symmetric around the center of the channel. This mirroring approach does not precisely address the nominal biasing conditions at the source and drain; thus, we need to model the two halves separately. In this paper, we propose a bias-dependent (i.e., drain voltage (VDS) dependent) capacitance extraction of an NSFET using a de-mirroring approach. The electric field coupling from the drain to the source impacts the capacitances. The obtained results reveal that the mirroring approach overestimates the capacitances by ~15%, which is accurately predicted by our proposed de-mirroring approach.</div>

For transistors, self-heating and aging are representative dynamics of short and long terms, respectively. Hysteresis due to the forward and backward physical process is also shown up in thin film transistors and negative capacitance MOSFETs.

The Gummel symmetry test is utilized for symmetry analysis, confirming the symmetry of the drain current and the continuity of its derivatives, down to cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear behavior of the model is evaluated through harmonic balance tests, with slopes at each temperature aligning well with expected physical trends. Furthermore, we have applied tree-top and slope ratio tests to evaluate the smooth transition of the model from weak to strong inversion, demonstrating consistent and smooth behavior in all regions of MOSFET operation at all temperatures.</div>

            <h3 class="title">Decoupling Polarization and Trap Charges by Direct Vmid Measurement for Insights into Dynamic Mechanisms of MFMIS-FeFET</h3>
            <div class="authors">Wenpu Luo,Runteng Zhu,Hanyong Shao,Yuejia Zhou,Ru Huang,Kechao Tang</div>
            <div class="abstract">In this work, the polarization switching (PFE) and charge trapping (Qtrap) were decoupled by direct middle gate (MG) voltage (Vmid) measurements on MFMIS-FeFET. The non-ideal effects of this method were thoroughly analyzed and optimized. According to the decoupled data, the channel side injection (Ct-Inj) and gate-side injection (Gt-Inj) were both observed, consistent with the previous reports. New phenomena regarding the frequency dependent Qtrap, PFE speed and Vmid amplitude were also revealed. We proposed that PFE has a stronger gate voltage dependence than Ch-Inj, explaining all the findings. Based on these findings, guidelines for optimizing the writing frequency to enhance FeFET endurance were proposed.</div>

            <div class="abstract">In this work, we propose a foundation model framework to unify various pre-trained approaches for neural compact modeling. By leveraging extensive simulation data from established technology nodes, such a framework aims to capture shared physical device characteristics. This approach enables multiple applications including anomaly detection in measurement data, compact model generation from limited data, and model retargeting for specific electrical parameters. We propose an automated modeling framework integrating these capabilities for PDK model generation.</div>

            <div class="abstract">We present a framework to capture essential physics of operation of devices built on Gallium Nitride technology for High-Voltage (HV) and power applications. Devices include Unidirectional (UDS) and Bi-directional Switches (BDS) that span voltages between 60-650V. The modeling framework is based on well-known industry standard MVSG Verilog-A compact model platform. The model is proven to distill essential device physics to predict device-circuit interactions in power conversion applications. In this work, we show the model comparison against DC-IVs, CVs, switching measurements of UDS and BDS along with a demonstration of slew-rate prediction; a key device-circuit interaction effect. Secondary effects such as self-heating, charge-trapping, P-GaN gate-dynamics are also highlighted.</div>
