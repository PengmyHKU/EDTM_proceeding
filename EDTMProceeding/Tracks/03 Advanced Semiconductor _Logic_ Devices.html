            <div class="abstract">This study reports fabrication of high-performance IGTO field-effect transistors via atomic layer deposition, enabling precise cation ratio control. The IGTO thin-film with 7.2 at% Sn exhibited preferential (222) crystal growth. The resulting FET achieved exceptional performance, including a field-effect mobility of 88.3 ± 1.7 cm2/Vs, low subthreshold swing of 61.2 ± 1.1 mV/dec, and VTH of 0.15 ± 0.1 V.

            <div class="abstract">Artificial spiking neurons based on NbOx memristors are widely used in neuromorphic systems, but their performance generally exhibits limited reconfigurability after the forming process. Herein, we present a method for post-forming the device through annealing to facilitate performance modulation. This post-annealing process facilitates the diffusion of oxygen vacancies into the NbOx layer, subsequently altering its performance characteristics. The proposed method enhances the tunability of artificial neurons and paves the way for adaptable neuromorphic devices. </div>

Based on them, we show electrical transient measurements demonstrating the functionality of a highly reconfigurable logic gate, the RGATE, able to yield up to eight different logic functions using only four transistors.

In this work, we demonstrate large-scale, wafer-level 3D integration of MoS₂ and WSe₂ field-effect transistors (FETs) across multiple tiers. This includes a 2-tier integration of MoS₂ FETs with over 10,000 devices per tier and a 3-tier architecture combining n-type MoS₂ and p-type WSe₂ FETs, supporting logic, memory, and sensing functions within a single chip. Scaled to channel lengths as short as 45 nm, the integration process remains BEOL-compatible. Additionally, we present a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic platform using 3D monolithic integration of WSe₂ n-FETs and p-FETs, demonstrating high-performance CMOS gates with inter-tier via connections under 1 µm. We further explore heterogeneous integration by stacking graphene-based chemisensors with MoS₂ memtransistors in a two-tier architecture, achieving 62,500 I/O per mm² and low-latency near-sensor computing.

This work systematically investigated the passivation effects of PECVD SiO2, Si3N4, and sputtered Al2O3. Results indicate that the 150 °C PECVD Si3N4 passivation layer (PL) offers SATG TFTs superior stability under thermal, environmental and bias stress conditions, along with excellent scalability and well-maintained low S/D resistance, compared to other PLs.</div>

            <div class="authors">Seungjoon Eom,Sanguk Lee,Rockhyun Baek</div>
            <div class="abstract">Gate-All-Around (GAA) nanosheet field-effect transistors (NSFETs) face challenges with stacking faults (SFs) that disrupt stress transmission, affecting device performance. This study categorizes these faults and examines their impact on stress, carrier mobility, and I-V characteristics using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. Results demonstrate that specific fault types significantly alter stress distribution and electrical characteristics, leading to variations in boron diffusion rates and on/off-current, thereby emphasizing the importance of managing SFs to enhance p-type NSFET performance.</div>

            <div class="abstract">The design of VFET is comprehensively studied by the DTCO methodology for the first time. The Vertical Nanosheet design outperforms the Horizontal one by ~7% performance gain, with ~33% reduction of cell area. A significant Ieff improvement (~20%) and Cgd reduction (~30%) in the Forward mode were identified, leading to ~68% better performance than the Reverse mode. A novel mixed design of Forward and Reverse mode is proposed for complex stdcell with vertical nanosheets placement.</div>

            <div class="authors">Zhuming Wang,Chen Wang,Kun Chen,Wei Zhang</div>
            <div class="abstract">As semiconductor technology advances, Ruthenium (Ru) emerges as a promising interconnect material. However, its integration into advanced Backside Power Delivery Networks (BSDPN) faces significant challenges due to the high-temperature processing requirements of front-end-of-line (FEOL) fabrication. This study demonstrates that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a viable barrier layer for Ru-based BSDPN interconnects, enabling them to withstand high-temperature processing without significant diffusion , highlighting the promising future of h-BN for next-generation integrated circuits.</div>

            <div class="authors">Sihao Chen,Honglin Wu,Runsheng Wang,Ru Huang,Lining Zhang</div>
            <div class="abstract">The thermal crosstalk issue in various typical circuit layouts featuring 3nm Gate-all-around transistors (GAAFET) is systematically investigated in this work. In a standard inverter with 6 tracks, thermal crosstalk from the active NMOS induces a temperature rise in the adjacent PMOS, elevating it by 7.5% above the ambient temperature. Further increasing the number of devices to three and four results in temperature increases of 11.8% and 14.9%, respectively. Moreover, the dynamic thermal response time and transient heating behavior induced by thermal crosstalk are found to be strongly dependent on device density and layout configuration, indicating that high-precision thermal modeling and thermal-aware reliability assessment urgently need to account for thermal crosstalk effects in advanced CMOS technology.</div>

            <div class="authors">Dun-Bao Ruan,Zefu Zhao</div>
            <div class="abstract">A plasma-enhanced supercritical phase fluid (SCF) process is proposed on a Ge FinFET CMOS inverter to resolve the insufficient oxidation in large-size chamber and unavailable nitridation effects with SCF system. The metastable low oxidation state components and interface traps in high-k and interfacial layer are clearly reduced by supplemented oxygen and nitrogen radicals in SCF. As a result, Ge FinFET with enhanced oxidation and partially nitridation (EOPN)-SCF treatment exhibit better electrical performance and reliability characteristics.</div>

            <div class="abstract">Complementary field-effect transistors (CFETs) have been seriously studied for next-generation device architectures to improve PPA (power, performance, and area). However, many challenges remain, including process integration, structure optimization, implementation schemes (monolithic/sequential), etc. At the transistor level, unbalanced transport between n- and p-FET would be one of the most critical issues because CFETs inherently require the same width both for n- and p-FETs. Furthermore, new parameters such as spacing length between top and bottom FETs have emerged. Here, we discuss the opportunity for heterogeneous channel design to mitigate these issues. </div>

            <div class="authors">XIAO GONG</div>
            <div class="abstract">In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evolving understanding of reliability issues in oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (OSFETs), with a focus on bias temperature instability (BTI) and the critical role of hydrogen (H)-related degradation. Through systematic analyses of high-performance Indium-Gallium-Zinc-oxide (IGZO) devices, we highlight four key findings: (1) the existence of two distinct hydrogen states, distinguishable under varying stress and recovery conditions; (2) a pronounced channel length (LCH) dependence of threshold voltage shift (ΔVth) under negative BTI (NBTI); (3) thinner channel devices are more prone to electron trapping but demonstrate higher resistance to H effects; and (4) notable differences between AC and DC positive BTI (PBTI) behavior at elevated T conditions. These insights offer valuable guidance for optimizing device design and advancing future research in this field.</div>
