            <div class="abstract">This paper presents the design of a THz communication transceiver system based on fan-out wafer-level package (FOWLP) technology for high-speed chip-to-chip (C2C) wireless interconnect applications. The design focus on the transceiver (TR), antenna in package (AiP)s, and interconnect transition structures, integrating coaxial-like structures and coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line transitions to enable low-loss signal transmission across both vertical and horizontal pathways. Simulation results show that the proposed FOWLP structures achieve an insertion loss of less than 1 dB and a return loss greater than 10 dB within the 25-60 GHz range for the local oscillator (LO) frequency band. The AiP provides an impedance match of -15 dB within the 200-230 GHz range for the radio frequency (RF) band. Link budget calculations further verify that the proposed system enables C2C communication at data rates up to 10 Gbps, highlighting its potential for advanced interconnect applications.proposed structures can achieve insertion loss less than 1 dB and return loss greater than 10 dB within the 25-60 GHz frequency band. antenna-in-package (AiP) achieves an impedance of -15 dB within the 200-230 GHz range.

            <div class="abstract">Hetero-integrated β-Ga2O3-on-diamond (GaOD) SBDs were fabricated using transfer printing technology. The GaOD SBDs showed a more uniform Schottky barrier than the β-Ga2O3 Bulk (GaO Bulk) SBDs. Pulse I-V characteristics revealed a significantly reduced self-heating effect in GaOD SBDs compared to GaO Bulk SBDs. The device thermal resistance was as low as 16.69 K/W, only 1/11 of that of GaO Bulk SBDs.

            <div class="abstract">The n-Ga2O3/n-SiC (GaOSiC) hetero-structure was achieved by ion-cutting process based on surface activated bonding (SAB) and hydrophilic bonding (HB) techniques. The HB GaOSiC hetero-interface showed an amorphous layer of only ~1 nm, contributing to 16.87% of the total on-resistance (Ron,total) for the GaOSiC structure, which is much less than that of the SAB hetero-interface. The low interface resistance (Ri) of HB GaOSiC structure provides a feasible path towards the vertical β-Ga2O3 power electronics with high power operating capability and acceptable heat dissipation performance.</div>

            <div class="abstract">Poor thermal management has hindered electronics toward high-power development. Herein, novel thermal-spreading strategies for wide-bandgap heterostructures were systematically investigated. For example, thermal properties (TBR, thermal conductivity) of polycrystalline diamond grown on or as substrate replacements as-well-as bonding to GaN-HEMT were measured by transient-thermoreflectance. A-series-of high-thermal-conductivity interface-buffer-layer materials and diamond growth parameters were designed to compare their effects on TBR and thermal conductivity. The thermal management optimization of diamond integrated GaN-HEMT devices were also explored. In addition, the interfacial structure/stress tuning and the hidden coupling mechanism were revealed. This work provides essential guidance for integration design of material-growth and bonding to further unleash the heat-dissipation performance of wide-bandgap electronics.</div>

            <div class="abstract">In this work, we have demonstrated high performance β-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) with superior power figure-of-merit (PFOM) and breakdown voltage (Vbr) by adopting the N ion-implantation edge termination (NIET) structure. It is observed that the introduction of the NIET structure significantly reduces the reverse leakage current, in the meanwhile, it can maintain the decent forward characteristic. The device with the N ion implantation at the edge of the Schottky electrode exhibited a Vbr of 1.65 kV, a specific on-resistance (Ron,sp) of 5.34 mΩ·cm2, a PFOM of 0.509 GW/cm2, and a reverse current density of 5.5 × 10−6 A/cm2 @ −1000 V.
