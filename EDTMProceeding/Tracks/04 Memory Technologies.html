            <div class="abstract">This study investigates the optimization of charge-trap silicon nitride (CT-SiN) for 3D NAND flash memories. We employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analysis to identify the material properties influencing electron-trap levels, trap density, and program/erase (P/E) endurance. Our results demonstrate that a near-stoichiometric N/Si ratio of 1.13 offers the deeper electron traps and higher trap density, leading to improved P/E endurance. This study paves the way for significantly improved performance of CT-SiN in future 3D NAND devices.</div>

Furthermore, the conductance level and conductance variation of a 256k 3T-SSpF array are evaluated, and a typical neural network is implemented and applied to the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

The results indicate that using the stronger oxidant (O3) leads to higher remanent polarization (Pr) but poorer endurance, with significant leakage deterioration after wakeup and a pronounced imprint effect during cycling. In contrast, the weaker oxidant (H2O) results in lower Pr but improves polarization switching speed. The influence of oxidants on pre-existing defects and interfacial reactions may be potential key factors.

            <div class="abstract">The miniaturization of magnetic memory to nanometer scale requires a theoretical model to accurately predict the switching current. Previous models show large discrepancy with experimental results in studying the spin-orbit torque switching of perpendicular magnets. In this study, we find that magnetization follows a smooth transition during the switching, which allows for a reduced switching current. Guided by this refined physical picture, we identify the reversal of precession chirality as a pivotal factor and develop an analytical model which shows good alignment with the experimental data. Our work provides a more comprehensive understanding of the current-induced magnetization switching mechanism, which will benefit the developments in spin-orbit torque magnetic random-access memory.</div>

As a result, an artificial spiking thermoreceptor (AST) and an artificial spiking photoreceptor (ASP) are both realized by using a single flexible VO2 Mott memristor. With the stimulus temperature elevated from 20 °C to 40 °C, the spiking frequency of AST first increases, then falls off rather quickly to zero at the higher temperature of 45 °C, resembling the response characteristics of biological thermoreceptor. And the ASP has high spike-encoded photosensitivity and ultra-wide photosensing range (405~808 nm). Finally, the spike-based electronic retina is proposed by connecting an array of artificial spiking photoreceptors with multiple-input floating gate MOS transistors acting as optical nerves.

At a negative Vds, the device operates as a photodetector with a volatile photo response, while at positive Vds, the photo transistor served as a photo memory achieving a high resistance ratio of approximately 103.

An evaluation of both techniques was carried out in the context of leaky and non-leaky samples. However, it was observed that both PUND and DLCC were unable to fully compensate for large amounts of leakage currents in very leaky samples (<1 A/cm2 at 3 MV/cm applied voltage).

This paper explores CAM hierarchies (similar to the standard RAM hierarchy), focusing on two implementation layers: non-volatile, analog Content Addressable Memory (aCAM) for static data patterns, and volatile, gain cell-based aCAM for dynamic tasks. Mitigating key non-idealities in memristor-based aCAMs increases storage from 2 to 4 bits per cell, enhancing performance, capacity, and energy efficiency for Compute in Memory (CIM) applications.</div>

            <div class="abstract">In this paper, a novel superlattice (SL) HfO2-ZrO2 ferroelectric (FE) junction-modulated tunnel FET (TFET) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated with overall improvement in memory window (MW), equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) and disturb immunity. The gate stack is optimized with SL FE layer for larger MW and smaller EOT simultaneously which usually has an optimization conflict in conventional FE layer. In addition, a more abrupt tunnel junction is introduced by a striped gate stack design, which is found to further increase the MW. The fabricated novel SL FE-JTFET demonstrates a 2.6× improvement in MW along with a 19% reduction in EOT comparing to FE-TFET, which is very beneficial for practical read current margin improvement. Moreover, the SL FE layer can also mitigate the disturb issue in the memory operations, showing the great potential of proposed device for practical low-power and high-robust memory applications.</div>

            <div class="abstract">In this work, four ferroelectric (FE) capacitors with thickness dependent ZrO2 middle layer (ML) were designed and fabricated at the low annealing temperature of 350 ℃. By modulating the thickness of ZrO2 ML, it is demonstrated that the FE capacitor with 2 nm ZrO2 ML exhibits a superior double remanent polarization (2Pr) of 36.7 µC/cm² under the Vop of 2 V. The insertion of ZrO₂ ML effectively suppresses the wakeup effect in the FE capacitor and decreases the wakeup ratio by approximately 31 % under the low operating voltage of 2 V. In addition, the FE capacitor with ML presents an excellent endurance property of the cycling characteristic.

            <div class="abstract">To advance DRAM technology, balancing high permittivity with reliability remains a critical challenge. This study achieves ultra-high permittivity (~67) and low leakage (3E-8 A/cm2 at 0.8 V) in hafnium-based films through combined modulation of oxygen vacancy (VO) and Zr content. TDDB and endurance tests confirm the superior reliability of these films. By adjusting ozone dose time during atomic layer deposition (ALD), oxygen vacancies are flexibly controlled, influencing phase ratio to induce morphotropic phase boundary and significantly enhance permittivity. The synergistic effect of Zr content further boosts permittivity while mitigating reliability issues. This co-modulation strategy overcomes traditional trade-offs between high permittivity and reliability, providing a promising approach for next-generation high-performance DRAM applications.</div>

For semiconductor memories such as DRAM and FeRAM, metal-insulator-metal and metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors play crucial roles, and their high-frequency characteristics (e.g. from 3MHz to 3GHz) significantly impact the device performance. However, conventional measurement techniques such as the bridge method struggle to provide accurate capacitance values at such frequencies, posing a challenge for memory technology development. In this work, we introduce our recent studies on two high-frequency capacitance measurement techniques: the network analysis method and the transient signal method. The initial results suggest both methods can accurately extract DUT capacitance up to 1GHz, offering valuable insights for memory device innovation.</div>

            <div class="authors">Huajun Qin</div>
            <div class="abstract">Magnonics offers a promising prospect for low-power, wave-based computing. Active control of spin waves is essential for practical realization of magnonic technology. Here we introduce nanoscale magnonic Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators, waveguides, and magnonic crystals (MCs) for low-loss spin-wave guiding and manipulation. These devices are made of an array of ferromagnetic metal (FM) nanostripes patterned on a low-damping yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. In an array of magnonic FP resonators where two edges of each FM stripe act as two sharp magnetic interfaces, propagating spin waves coherently circulate between the two magnetic interfaces of the resonator and interfere destructively to form transmission gaps with the depth down to the background level. Thus-formed gaps, called as FP gaps, can be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states and efficiently tuned over a wide frequency range via the variation of the stripe width, strip number, and film thickness. When the period between FP resonators meets the Bragg condition, the MCs with deep gaps and low-loss minibands are produced. The MC gaps can also be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states. Moreover, these FP and MC gaps are strongly hybridized when approaching each other, resulting in the gap anti-crossing.  In the magnonic waveguide, the downshift of spin-wave dispersion due to the small effective magnetic field in the YIG and FM region enables the guiding of spin-wave propagation along the nanostripe. We report on low-loss spin-wave channeling in straight and curved nanoscopic waveguides, and further demonstrate reversible control of the spin-wave propagation by changing the frequency and magnetic bias field in a hybrid waveguiding structure. Based on these results, spin-wave filter, multiplexer, and beam splitter using low-loss YIG and FM hybrid structures have been proposed.</div>
