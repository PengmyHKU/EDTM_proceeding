Updates 20250307
1. Fix some bugs.
2. Make the pdf link to open a new tab rather than opening it in the current window (to easily review several papers). 
3. Add link and abstract for T-9-1-2 [Invited]. "Advanced Micro-Transfer Printing Technology for Heterogeneous Integration." from the pdf EDTM25-000558 "Diode Microheaters for Scalable Actuation in Micro-Transfer Printing" of the same author with a different title. The pdf file is already contained last time.

To do next
1. continue to do the inspection and testing to check if there is still wrong or missing (Keyi).
2. Add links and abstracts for the last missing pdf (leaving the link&abstract blank for now).
    (1) T-11-2-1 [Keynote] "Electronic Fabrics and Wearable Systems: Design, Fabrication, Evaluation." from Xiaoming Tao, Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The auther/paper is not found in the platform. Checking with the track chair, waiting for a reply. 



##Updates 20250304
1. Update a new version to make what exists consistent with the latest program book.
2. Add the poster page for poster paper.
3. Add link and abstract for 3 new submitted manuscripts (others already added): M-7-1-1 [Keynote] Insulators for Devices Based on 2D Materials. M-3-2-1 [Invited] Ferroelectric 3D NAND Storage. T-1-1-5 [Invited] Phase Change Memory: From Technological Challenges to Materials Science.
4. tune the homepage font size automatically for smart phone. 

To do next
1. inspection and testing to check if there is still wrong or missing (Keyi).
2. Add links and abstracts for the 6 missing pdfs (mentioned before).
    (1) T-9-1-2 [Invited]. "Advanced Micro-Transfer Printing Technology for Heterogeneous Integration." from Yunda Wang, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. It is said to check with the track chair that if it is EDTM25-000558 "Diode Microheaters for Scalable Actuation in Micro-Transfer Printing" from the same author, but no feedback yet.
    (2) T-11-2-1 [Keynote] "Electronic Fabrics and Wearable Systems: Design, Fabrication, Evaluation." from Xiaoming Tao, Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The auther/paper is not found in the platform. And there is also no feedback. 
    


## 20250301
1. Make a minimum version to make what exists consistent with the program book.
2. Add chairs of the tracks.
3. Mark the date and weekdays to make it less confusing.
4. Some bugs fixed.

To do next week
1. Prepare the csv for the poster (Bo).
2. Add the poster page (Muyuan).
3. inspection and testing to check if there is wrong or missing (Keyi).
4. Add links and abstracts for the 6 missing pdfs (mentioned before).
    (1) M-7-1-1 [Keynote].
    (2) M-3-2-1 [Invited].
    (3) T-9-1-2 [Invited].
    (4) T-1-1-5 [Invited].
    (5) T-11-2-1 [Keynote].
    (6) W-11-3-2 [Invited].



## 20250227
Works have done 

1. Add tracks and abstract to be folded.

2. Add venue of the tracks.

3. Add time and ID like 'M-1-2-3' in program for each paper.

4. Change the order of papers to list the papers just like what the program does (with several time intervals like 9:25am to 10:50am).

5. Include affiliations of the authors like the program.

To do next if necessary

1. Add 4 Plenary talk

2. Add other information which is not related to papers in platform like Coffee Break or Opening Ceremony or FET 100 Special Session

3. Check if there is mistake or missing (needs help)

4. Add links and abstracts for the 6 pdfs which is missing now

    (1) M-7-1-1 [Keynote] Insulators for Devices Based on 2D Materials. (Keynote) Tibor Grasser, TU Wien, Austria

    Probelm: needs to be accepted but pending now. It is on track 07 (invited).

    (2) M-3-2-1 [Invited] Ferroelectric 3D NAND Storage. Asif Islam Khan, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA

    Problem: same problem as (1), already accepted in platform, will be updated with (1).

    (3) T-9-1-2 [Invited] Advanced Micro-Transfer Printing Technology for Heterogeneous Integration. Yunda Wang, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong

    Problem: found another paper named "Diode Microheaters for Scalable Actuation in Micro-Transfer Printing" in system which is from the same author in the same invited track 9, seems that they have changed the paper name. checking with the track chair...

    (4) T-1-1-5 [Invited] Phase Change Memory: From Technological Challenges to Materials Science. Zhitang Song, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, CAS, China

    Problem: missing. The authors will submit a paper for it. 

    (5) T-11-2-1 [Keynote] Electronic Fabrics and Wearable Systems: Design, Fabrication, Evaluation. Xiaoming Tao, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong

    Problem: missing. Not found the author/paper in the platform.

    (6)  W-11-3-2 [Invited] AI-boosted wireless near-infrared wearable sensing system for advancing muscle-tracking technology. Wubin Bai, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA

    Problem: the authors want a different title of the talk from that of the paper named "Magnetic Resonance based Soft Electronic Implant for Wireless Electrotherapy and Thermal Ablation". considering if it needs to add the link or abstract since they look quite different.
