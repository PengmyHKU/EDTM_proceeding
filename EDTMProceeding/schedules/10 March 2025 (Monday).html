    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">Charge trapping at oxide defects is a significant reliability issue in MOS transistors and becomes even more prominent in scaled technology nodes. As devices shrink, the impact of charge capture and emission events of oxide and interface defects on performance becomes more severe. Our work demonstrates how charge trapping affects variability in scaled Silicon and 2D technologies, highlighting the necessity of low trap density to achieve high yield and ensure robust electronic circuit designs.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">Electrolyte-gated transistors can function as switching elements, artificial synapses and memristive systems. However, insight into such devices, including the ion dynamics and transient capacitances, remains limited. Here we report a concise model for the transient ion-dynamic capacitance in electrolyte-gated transistors. The model predicts that plasticity, high apparent mobility, sharp subthreshold swing, and memristive conductance can be achieved by programming interfacial ion concentrations or scan speeds. We demonstrate such multimode transistors and different capabilities experimentally.</div></details>

    <div class="authors">Xiao Gong, National University of Singapore, Singapore </div>
    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evolving understanding of reliability issues in oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (OSFETs), with a focus on bias temperature instability (BTI) and the critical role of hydrogen (H)-related degradation. Through systematic analyses of high-performance Indium-Gallium-Zinc-oxide (IGZO) devices, we highlight four key findings: (1) the existence of two distinct hydrogen states, distinguishable under varying stress and recovery conditions; (2) a pronounced channel length (LCH) dependence of threshold voltage shift (ΔVth) under negative BTI (NBTI); (3) thinner channel devices are more prone to electron trapping but demonstrate higher resistance to H effects; and (4) notable differences between AC and DC positive BTI (PBTI) behavior at elevated T conditions. These insights offer valuable guidance for optimizing device design and advancing future research in this field.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">The metal reaction approach has been successfully utilized to fabricate high-performance self-aligned top-gate (SATG) oxide TFTs with low-resistance source/drain (S/D) regions. However, the stability remains a concern, as the metal-reacted S/D regions are susceptible to degradation during thermal processing. This work systematically investigated the passivation effects of PECVD SiO2, Si3N4, and sputtered Al2O3. Results indicate that the 150 °C PECVD Si3N4 passivation layer (PL) offers SATG TFTs superior stability under thermal, environmental and bias stress conditions, along with excellent scalability and well-maintained low S/D resistance, compared to other PLs.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">The thermal crosstalk issue in various typical circuit layouts featuring 3nm Gate-all-around transistors (GAAFET) is systematically investigated in this work. In a standard inverter with 6 tracks, thermal crosstalk from the active NMOS induces a temperature rise in the adjacent PMOS, elevating it by 7.5% above the ambient temperature. Further increasing the number of devices to three and four results in temperature increases of 11.8% and 14.9%, respectively. Moreover, the dynamic thermal response time and transient heating behavior induced by thermal crosstalk are found to be strongly dependent on device density and layout configuration, indicating that high-precision thermal modeling and thermal-aware reliability assessment urgently need to account for thermal crosstalk effects in advanced CMOS technology.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">In this work, the electric characteristics of IGZTO thin-film transistors (TFTs) with ultra-thin channel thicknesses (TCH) down to 3 nm were systematically investigated. As TCH decreases, a positive shift in threshold voltage (Vth) is observed, with the 3 nm device showing a Vth around 0.9 V and a field-effect mobility of 30.3 cm2(V·s)-1. The 5 nm device, featuring an appropriate Vth of 0.36 V, achieves an optimal balance with high mobility, highlighting the potential of IGZTO TFTs in sub-10 nm process technology for low-power applications.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">The integration of metal oxide TFTs is challenged by high BEOL temperatures. Our study evaluated ALD-deposited IGZO TFTs with different composition ratio. These TFTs exhibited mobilities ranging from 30.24 to 81.60 cm2V-1s-1. The optimized-composition In0.25Ga0.26Zn0.49O TFT without encapsulation, maintained performance after 450°C annealing process and exhibited enhanced thermal stability, reducing the threshold voltage shift from over 15 V to -1.5 V. This enhancement is attributed to the stabilization of the amorphous structure, optimization of the coordination number, and reduction of defect states.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) match input data to stored content, ideal for search-intensive tasks like network address lookup and similarity matching. This paper explores CAM hierarchies (similar to the standard RAM hierarchy), focusing on two implementation layers: non-volatile, analog Content Addressable Memory (aCAM) for static data patterns, and volatile, gain cell-based aCAM for dynamic tasks. Mitigating key non-idealities in memristor-based aCAMs increases storage from 2 to 4 bits per cell, enhancing performance, capacity, and energy efficiency for Compute in Memory (CIM) applications.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">A thorough review of recent advances in compact modeling for advanced semiconductor technology is performed. The development of compacting modeling is based on the modeling coordinate system, which is composed of model applications, modeling techniques, and modeling scenarios. From the perspective of the model application, recent developments include advanced logic devices without/with the backside power delivery network (BSPDN) and their design technology co-optimizations (DTCO), computing memories, cryogenic CMOS, etc. Along the dimension of modeling techniques, recent advancements span AI-assisted modeling and fusion modeling, besides the traditional approaches. In terms of modeling scenarios, dynamic modeling has been discussed more often recently, in addition to the classical static modeling scenarios. By reviewing the modeling coordinate system, we aim to provide a holistic picture of the recent advances for deeper understanding and alignment toward a better compact modeling community. </div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">One key assumption behind the compact modeling of semiconductor devices is the quasi-static approximations (QSA). However, more emerging devices or phenomena in classical devices show characteristics of rich dynamics for which a paradigm shift from QSA is required. This work reviews the representative dynamics-rich device behaviors, spanning a variety of devices from transistors to memories. For transistors, self-heating and aging are representative dynamics of short and long terms, respectively. Hysteresis due to the forward and backward physical process is also shown up in thin film transistors and negative capacitance MOSFETs. For non-volatile memories, an individual state variable is dynamically evolving with dependences on the voltage or current stimulus. Applications of the dynamic time evolution method (DTEM) to these dynamic scenarios are reviewed, for accurate and efficient circuit simulations.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">With the Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) being increasingly significant in IGZO-DRAM, a surface potential-based compact model is highly required. For better understanding the disorder effects, an in-house TCAD tool is proposed to study sub-threshold properties. On this basis, a unified surface potential based compact is provided with underlying transport mechanisms for various structures. By addressing critical reliability issues, such as D2D and C2C variability, it enables the TCAD-to-SPICE framework for realizing a reliability-aware DTCO flow of IGZO-DRAM.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">This paper presents recent advances in contact-controlled transistors supported by numerical simulation using Silvaco Atlas. In such devices, the source injection area, rather than the channel, governs drain current magnitude. Their correct design and application relies on deep understanding of internal operation; therefore technology computer-aided design (TCAD) is a useful optimization tool for established source-gated transistors (SGT) and emerging multimodal transistors (MMT) alike. In the absence of compact models, mixed-mode circuit simulations provide a valuable route toward application design.</div></details>

Silicon is renowned for its excellent starting material quality, its ease of processing, the opportunity for low-cost mass production, proven reliability, and circuit design legacy. However, despite significant progress, silicon devices are now approaching their operational limits. They are held back by their relatively low bandgap and low critical electric field, traits that result in high conduction and switching losses and a substandard high-temperature performance. To address these shortcomings, much effort has been directed at increasing the competitiveness of commercial SiC power devices.</div></details>

By vertically stacking the pFET atop the nFET, CFETs achieve a profound reduction in the cell area, presenting a viable pathway to meet extreme density demands. Utilizing the industry-standard BSIM-CMG model, we carefully calibrate the CFET device’s electrical characteristics against measurements from fabricated devices. Our calibrated model is then applied to a 6T-SRAM cell and critical peripheral circuits, including pre-charge, sense amplifier, and latch configurations. Comprehensive SPICE simulations enable a detailed assessment of SRAM performance, quantifying noise margins, access delays, and power dissipation across both read and write cycles. Our analysis further dissects the delay and power contributions along the signal path, underscoring CFET’s transformative potential in advancing SRAM scalability and efficiency in leading-edge technology nodes.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">This work provides a comprehensive analysis of threshold voltage (Vth) variability (σVth) in negative capacitance (NC) junctionless (JL) transistors on siliconon- insulator (SOI) and bulk substrates through well-calibrated simulations. Bulk NCJL transistors show improved performance due to a shift in the conduction channel towards the front surface, which improves the gate capacitance (Cgg) and enhances the negative capacitance in bulk NCJL devices. The results highlight a significant reduction in σVth by ~89 %, ~91 %, ~60 %, ~80 %, and ~56 % due to the variations in gate length (Lg), silicon film thickness (Tsi), equivalent oxide
thickness (EOT), channel doping (Nch), and ferroelectric thickness (Tfe), respectively. Additionally, the reduced Vth variability further translates to an enhanced noise margin (NM) and improved process induced NM variations in inverter circuits. The results reported for the first time showcase the superior performance of bulk NCJL designs compared to SOI NCJL transistors.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">The sheets/channels are vertically stacked in Nanosheet FET (NSFET), which forms a complex capacitive network. Till date, to the best of our knowledge, the only bias-independent capacitance model for NSFET has been presented by considering that the device is mirrored symmetric around the center of the channel. This mirroring approach does not precisely address the nominal biasing conditions at the source and drain; thus, we need to model the two halves separately. In this paper, we propose a bias-dependent (i.e., drain voltage (VDS) dependent) capacitance extraction of an NSFET using a de-mirroring approach. The electric field coupling from the drain to the source impacts the capacitances. The obtained results reveal that the mirroring approach overestimates the capacitances by ~15%, which is accurately predicted by our proposed de-mirroring approach.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">The development of high-performance artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing offers a potential solution to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck. However, most artificial synapses rely on electrical manipulation, limiting their applications. In this study, we have created an optoelectronic synaptic transistor based on two-dimensional (2D) ReSe2 that can simulate excitatory synaptic behaviors under light stimulations. Our proposed optoelectronic controlled synaptic device using 2D ReSe2 provides a promising platform for versatile neuromorphic applications.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">Hardware implementations of bio-plausible neurons are highly valuable for developing sparse and efficient neuromorphic computing systems. However, traditional CMOS-based neurons require complex auxiliary circuits and bulky capacitors. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a VO2 memristor-based adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire (ALIF) neuron that enables advanced spike-frequency adaptation with ultra-low hardware cost (2T2R1C). These ALIF neurons serve as neural encoders, efficiently extracting temporal signal features with a sparse-spiking yet high-fidelity method. The spiking neural network (SNN) with ALIF achieves 97.1% accuracy in electromyography classification, showing great potential in human-computer interaction.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">Neuromorphic systems process information efficiently, but scalable hardware implementation of synaptic units remains challenging. In this work, we fabricated silicon-rich silicon nitride films as the gate dielectric and leveraged charge trap interactions with MoS₂ to simulate both electrical and optoelectronic synaptic functions in a single device. This device exhibits excellent linearity with positive weights (R^2 =0.99) and demonstrates significant photo-induced short-term plasticity. Additionally, the entire fabrication process is CMOS-compatible, facilitating large-scale integration.</div></details>
