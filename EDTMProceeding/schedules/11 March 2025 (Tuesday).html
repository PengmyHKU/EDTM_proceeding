    <div class="authors">Saptarshi Das, Pennsylvania State University, USA </div>
    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">Monolithic three-dimensional (3D) integration of 2D materials represents a transformative advancement in semiconductor technology, enabling higher device density and multifunctionality. In this work, we demonstrate large-scale, wafer-level 3D integration of MoS₂ and WSe₂ field-effect transistors (FETs) across multiple tiers. This includes a 2-tier integration of MoS₂ FETs with over 10,000 devices per tier and a 3-tier architecture combining n-type MoS₂ and p-type WSe₂ FETs, supporting logic, memory, and sensing functions within a single chip. Scaled to channel lengths as short as 45 nm, the integration process remains BEOL-compatible. Additionally, we present a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic platform using 3D monolithic integration of WSe₂ n-FETs and p-FETs, demonstrating high-performance CMOS gates with inter-tier via connections under 1 µm. We further explore heterogeneous integration by stacking graphene-based chemisensors with MoS₂ memtransistors in a two-tier architecture, achieving 62,500 I/O per mm² and low-latency near-sensor computing. These advancements pave the way for highly dense, multifunctional, low-power 3D integrated circuits based on 2D materials.</div></details>

    <div class="authors">Sanghyeon Kim, KAIST, South Korea </div>
    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">Complementary field-effect transistors (CFETs) have been seriously studied for next-generation device architectures to improve PPA (power, performance, and area). However, many challenges remain, including process integration, structure optimization, implementation schemes (monolithic/sequential), etc. At the transistor level, unbalanced transport between n- and p-FET would be one of the most critical issues because CFETs inherently require the same width both for n- and p-FETs. Furthermore, new parameters such as spacing length between top and bottom FETs have emerged. Here, we discuss the opportunity for heterogeneous channel design to mitigate these issues. </div></details>

    <div class="authors">Heng Wu, Peking University, China </div>
    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">In this work, we proposed a new 3D integration technology: the Flip 3D integration (F3D), consisting of the 3D transistor stacking, the 3D dual-sided interconnects, the 3D die-to-die stacking and the dual-sided Monolithic 3D (M3D). Based on a 32-bit FFET RISCV core, besides the scaling benefits of the Flip FET (FFET), the dual-sided signal routing shows even more routing flexibility with 6.8% area reduction and 5.9% EDP improvement. Novel concepts of Multi-Flipping processes (Double Flips and Triple Flips) were proposed to relax the thermal budget constraints in the F3D and thus support the dual-sided M3D in the F3D. The core’s EDP and frequency are improved by up to 3.2% and 2.3% respectively, after BEOL optimizations based on the Triple Flips compared with unoptimized ones.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">In this paper, a novel superlattice (SL) HfO2-ZrO2 ferroelectric (FE) junction-modulated tunnel FET (TFET) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated with overall improvement in memory window (MW), equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) and disturb immunity. The gate stack is optimized with SL FE layer for larger MW and smaller EOT simultaneously which usually has an optimization conflict in conventional FE layer. In addition, a more abrupt tunnel junction is introduced by a striped gate stack design, which is found to further increase the MW. The fabricated novel SL FE-JTFET demonstrates a 2.6× improvement in MW along with a 19% reduction in EOT comparing to FE-TFET, which is very beneficial for practical read current margin improvement. Moreover, the SL FE layer can also mitigate the disturb issue in the memory operations, showing the great potential of proposed device for practical low-power and high-robust memory applications.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">The hot carriers-assisted photo-thermoelectric (PTE) infrared detector features ultrafast response and ultrahigh sensitivity. However, it suffers from a narrow response spectrum because the absorption is inherently limited by the material bandgap. Herein, we propose a phonon-mediated long-wave infrared response in PbSe/SrTiO3 heterostructure, in which the phonon absorption of SrTiO3 substrate greatly extend the photoresponse of hot carriers-assisted PTE infrared detector of PbSe from middle infrared to long-wave infrared. As a result, we achieve a responsivity of 3.2 mA W-1 (10 μm) at room temperature, indicating the promising applications of PbSe/SrTiO3 heterostructure for long-wave infrared sensing.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">In 2D layered systems, converting excessive photoexcited energy into an electrical response before losing it to the substrate is crucial for energy-efficient photodetection. These hot electron energy losses at photoemission junctions limit the carrier transfer, sensitivity, and modulation frequencies. Our study showcases improved photoresponse in macroscopic assembled graphene (MAG)/Si Schottky junctions by inserting a graphene (Gr) layer that electronically decouples MAG from Si. This van der Waals (vdW) engineering interface effectively suppresses dark current while maintaining hot carrier re-thermalization in the MAG film, leading to enhanced photo thermionic emission (PTI). This vdW interfacial engineering technique has broader implications in energy-efficient electronics, optoelectronics, and memory devices. </div></details>

    <div class="abstract">In this work, the design and measurement results of two different sizes of S-band internally matched power amplifiers (IMPAs) utilizing a single GaN HEMT bare-die with a total gate width of 4200 μm are presented. The first IMPA (PA 1) aiming for a smaller package size, only matches the impedance at the fundamental frequency. The output power and power-added efficiency (PAE) are 20W/55% and a gain variation of only ±0.2 dB within a 20% fractional bandwidth (FBW). Conversely, the second IMPA (PA 2) employs a 2nd-harmonic matching network, effectively enhancing the output power and PAE. Pulse measurement results show that PA 2 achieves a maximum PAE of 60% at a center frequency of 3 GHz, with a maximum saturated output power of 44 dBm (25 W).  Compared with PA 1, the lateral dimension of the package is increased by 4.5 × 3 mm2. Both IMPAs achieve an optimal trade-off between wide bandwidth, high PAE, and small size. </div></details>

    <div class="abstract">In the present study, an investigation as conducted into the effects of electron velocity modulation (∆ve/∆Vgs) and the short-channel effect (SCE) on high-frequency and DC performance for Sub-100 nm AlGaN/GaN HFETs. Experimental and simulation methods were employed to elucidate electron and heat transport in Sub-100 nm AlGaN/GaN HFETs. Devices with gate length (Lg) varying from 500 to 80 nm were fabricated. The devices exhibited  maximum transconductance (gm) when the aspect ratio (Lg/d) fell within the range of 3.84-8.56. Additionally, Lg/d exceeding 6.85 was found to effectively regulate the channel current for high-frequency applications, mitigating SCE while maintaining other device characteristics such as threshold voltage shift (∆Vth). As Lg scaled down from 350 to 80 nm, the larger ∆ve/∆Vgs resulting from increased Polarization Coulomb field (PCF) scattering continued to enhance the gm. </div></details>

Leveraging the dual-modulation effect and ambipolarity of FeTFET, the activation (x) is represented by drain-controlled band-to-band tunneling (BTBT), while XOR operations between the Key and stored encrypted weight (w_e) are performed by ferroelectric-gate-controlled non-monotonic BTBT at both drain and source junctions. The in-situ XOR cipher-encrypted AND-type multiplication is realized within a single FeTFET, fabricated on a 14 nm FinFET platform, thereby eliminating decryption circuits.

    <div class="abstract">In this work, an atomic layer etching (ALE) technique is proposed for p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN. The surface roughness was significantly reduced from 0.5 nm to 0.357 nm, after an ALE process with 15 s O2 modification step and 32 s BCl3 removal step. Additionally, the oxides product in O2 modification step can be effectively etched or removed. These findings indicate that O2/BCl3-based ALE technique is a promising approach for fabricating a variety of high-performance GaN devices that contain the p-GaN layer, such as p-GaN Gate HEMTs and GaN p-FETs.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">Bioelectronics encompassing electronic components and circuits for accessing human information play a vital role in real-time and continuous monitoring of biophysiological signals of electrophysiology, mechanical physiology, and electrochemical physiology. However, mechanical noise, particularly motion artifacts, poses a significant challenge in accurately detecting and analyzing target signals. While software-based “postprocessing” methods and signal filtering techniques have been widely employed, challenges such as signal distortion, major requirement of accurate models for classification, power consumption, and data delay inevitably persist. This review presents an overview of noise reduction strategies in bioelectronics, focusing on reducing motion artifacts and improving the signal-to-noise ratio through hardware-based approaches such as “preprocessing”. One of the main stress-avoiding strategies is reducing elastic mechanical energies applied to bioelectronics to prevent stress-induced motion artifacts. [1] Various approaches including strain-compliance, strain-resistance, and stress-damping techniques using unique materials and structures have been explored. Future research should optimize materials and structure designs, establish stable processes and measurement methods, and develop techniques for selectively separating and processing overlapping noises. Ultimately, these advancements will contribute to the development of more reliable and effective bioelectronics for healthcare monitoring and diagnostics.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">We tackle the thermal dissipation challenges inherent in three-dimensional (3D) stacked devices and explore innovative strategies to overcome these issues through advancements in materials and processes. Back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible materials, including aluminum nitride (AlN) and diamond are identified as promising dielectric solutions to enhance thermal management in 3D-stacked architectures. Furthermore, we propose the integration of phonon dispersion-matched bridging layers to effectively mitigate thermal boundary resistance, paving the way for improved thermal performance in stacked devices.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">The pitch scaling of the logic Back-End of the Line (BEOL) module is deteriorating capacitance of interconnect, which is one of the key factor of performance. Therefore, a number of researches are in progress to improve capacitance performance by lowering effective k-value of inter-metal dielectric (IMD) materials. For conventional IMD materials such as low-k (LK) and ultra low-k (ULK), those are vulnerable to the plasma induced damage (PID) during BEOL integration. As a consequence, an effective k-value of IMD must be deteriorated easily, which leads to serious performance degradation. In this paper, we developed high density low-k (HDLK) materials with higher PID resistance by using a new type of precursor, which is capable of generating bridged-carbon bonding (Si-C-Si). We achieved the 30% reduction of PID with HDLK compared to the conventional IMD. As a result, it resulted in the improvement of the BEOL interconnect capacitance by 3%. Throughout these results, we applied HDLK as a basic IMD material in narrow pitch layers of BEOL interconnect. In addition, we developed a different type of film with same precursor by tuning process conditions, which is called a high density ultra low-k (HDULK). This film is applicable to wider pitches of interconnect owing to remarkable characteristics such as lower k-value, good process integrity. Even though we utilized various precursors for each IMD materials in the past, HDLK and HDULK can be implemented by using just one single precursor. Thus, it is strongly expected to contribute to cost reduction.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">HfO2 with ferroelectricity has been widely investigated for memory and logic applications, including doped by Zr, Si, La, …etc. The superlamination (SL) technique exhibits higher capacitance and dielectric constant as compared to solid-solution (SS). The maximum dielectric constant achieves as high as 46 for HZZ at [Zr] = 66% with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) effect. Ferroelectric-based memory of ferroelectric capacitive memory (FCM) has gained significant attention due to the charge transfer concept, which is adopted with the SL technique. The SL technique exhibits higher capacitance and applicable remnant polarization (Pr) benefits for FCM application to demonstrate a CHCS/CLCS ratio of 245x.

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">In the era of artificial intelligence and big data, the demand for high-speed and reliable memory technologies is growing rapidly. For semiconductor memories such as DRAM and FeRAM, metal-insulator-metal and metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors play crucial roles, and their high-frequency characteristics (e.g. from 3MHz to 3GHz) significantly impact the device performance. However, conventional measurement techniques such as the bridge method struggle to provide accurate capacitance values at such frequencies, posing a challenge for memory technology development. In this work, we introduce our recent studies on two high-frequency capacitance measurement techniques: the network analysis method and the transient signal method. The initial results suggest both methods can accurately extract DUT capacitance up to 1GHz, offering valuable insights for memory device innovation.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">Magnonics offers a promising prospect for low-power, wave-based computing. Active control of spin waves is essential for practical realization of magnonic technology. Here we introduce nanoscale magnonic Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators, waveguides, and magnonic crystals (MCs) for low-loss spin-wave guiding and manipulation. These devices are made of an array of ferromagnetic metal (FM) nanostripes patterned on a low-damping yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. In an array of magnonic FP resonators where two edges of each FM stripe act as two sharp magnetic interfaces, propagating spin waves coherently circulate between the two magnetic interfaces of the resonator and interfere destructively to form transmission gaps with the depth down to the background level. Thus-formed gaps, called as FP gaps, can be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states and efficiently tuned over a wide frequency range via the variation of the stripe width, strip number, and film thickness. When the period between FP resonators meets the Bragg condition, the MCs with deep gaps and low-loss minibands are produced. The MC gaps can also be reconfigured by switching the magnetization states. Moreover, these FP and MC gaps are strongly hybridized when approaching each other, resulting in the gap anti-crossing.  In the magnonic waveguide, the downshift of spin-wave dispersion due to the small effective magnetic field in the YIG and FM region enables the guiding of spin-wave propagation along the nanostripe. We report on low-loss spin-wave channeling in straight and curved nanoscopic waveguides, and further demonstrate reversible control of the spin-wave propagation by changing the frequency and magnetic bias field in a hybrid waveguiding structure. Based on these results, spin-wave filter, multiplexer, and beam splitter using low-loss YIG and FM hybrid structures have been proposed.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">In this work, we present flexible VO2 Mott memristors with excellent electrical properties, i.e. low operating current (<100 μA), good endurance (>109) and good flexibility (bending radius ~5 mm) for constructing artificial spiking sensory neurons.  As a result, an artificial spiking thermoreceptor (AST) and an artificial spiking photoreceptor (ASP) are both realized by using a single flexible VO2 Mott memristor. With the stimulus temperature elevated from 20 °C to 40 °C, the spiking frequency of AST first increases, then falls off rather quickly to zero at the higher temperature of 45 °C, resembling the response characteristics of biological thermoreceptor. And the ASP has high spike-encoded photosensitivity and ultra-wide photosensing range (405~808 nm). Finally, the spike-based electronic retina is proposed by connecting an array of artificial spiking photoreceptors with multiple-input floating gate MOS transistors acting as optical nerves. Consequently, the color image is successfully segmented and the edges of objects in the image are clearly extracted through the electronic retina by simulation, thus providing a solid foundation for neuromorphic sensing system.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">This paper proposes the use of chip-integrated LC voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) as the B1 field source in NV diamond-based magnetometers. VCOs provide a compact, energy-efficient solution by directly converting DC power into the microwave B1 field required for NV center control, bypassing conventional RF amplification stages. Additionally, the VCO’s intrinsic frequency agility, enabled by the varactor inside the LC tank, which simultaneously changes the resonant frequency of the LC resonator and the oscillation frequency, ensures a near-constant B1 field across the tuning range. Current state-of-the-art chip-integrated diamond magnetometers, while showing promising results, typically make use of classical transmitter architectures, in general, providing a lower energy efficiency compared to the presented VCO-based approach. With its very good energy efficiency, the proposed VCO-based approach offers a path to scalable, low-power NV-based magnetometers suitable for portable and embedded applications. To provide a sufficiently large active area for typical diamond samples, the presented VCO-based $B_1$ generator uses an array of four injection-locked VCOs. An on-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) precisely defines the frequency of the B1 field from an external reference. The design is validated using electrical measurements that reflect the key metrics of the target quantum magnetometry application.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">Engineering robust solid-state quantum systems is amongst the most pressing challenges to realize scalable quantum photonic circuitry. While several 3D systems (such as diamond or gallium arsenid) have been thoroughly studied, solid state emitters in two dimensional (2D) materials are still in their infancy.  In this presentation I will discuss the appeal of an emerging van der Waals crystal – hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This unique system possesses a large bandgap of ~ 6 eV and can host single defects that can act as ultra-bright quantum light sources. In addition, some of these defects exhibit spin dependent fluorescence that can be initialised and coherently manipulated. I will discuss in details various methodologies to engineer these defects and show their peculiar properties. Furthermore, I will discuss how hBN crystals can be carefully sculpted into nanoscale photonic resonators to confine and guide light at the nanoscale. Taking advantage of the unique 2D nature of hBN, I will also show promising avenues to integrate hBN emitters with silicon nitride photonic crystal cavities. All in all, hBN possesses all the vital constituents to become the leading platform for integrated quantum photonics. To this extent, I will highlight the challenges and opportunities in engineering hBN quantum photonic devices and will frame it more broadly in the growing interest with 2D materials nanophotonics.   </div></details>

    <div class="abstract">The ability to map 3D forces is crucial in tactile sensors. However, most traditional sensors can generally only sense forces in one direction, that is, normal or shear stress. Here, we report a flexible sensor array, which is enabled by combining single-crystal piezoelectric films with different crystal orientations for direct 3D force mapping. Both normal and shear pressure can be quickly and freely distinguished without any crosstalk. This direct 3D sensing feedback has illustrated its high potential application in intelligent robotics, human-computer interaction, medical care, and health monitoring with real-time feedback.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">Artificial intelligence (AI) will enable machines to think and solve complex tasks like human beings. In recent years, artificial neural networks have improved recognition and classification accuracy. However, state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms require large network models with multiple layers, which pose significant challenges for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) implementation due to limitations in conjoining computation, memory, and communication requirements in large networks. As an alternative hardware platform, emerging memories have been proposed for weight storage and fast parallel neural computing with low power consumption. The parallelism property of the crossbar arrays for matrix-vector multiplication enables significant acceleration of core neural computations. In this talk, Prof. Choi will present a systematic study on the fundamental understanding of emerging memristive devices. He will talk about the approach how to achieve highly reliable artificial neurons and synapses for neuromorphic computing which can be a key step paving the way towards post von Neumann computing. In addition, he will also introduce the application of developed crossbar network, which suggests potential applications of emerging memory/computing device-based network to effective data processing for solving real-world problems. He will also talk about his recent work on phase change memory that shows low power consumption with cheap fabrication process. Finally, he will discuss the projections and future directions.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">This work systematically investigated the magnetoresistance switching behavior and back-hopping mechanisms of p-MTJs at high temperatures (up to 360 K). Experimental results show that the TMR ratio and the switching voltage (VC) of p-MTJs decrease with increasing temperature due to reduced magnetic anisotropy. The back-hopping phenomenon, characterized by random resistance state fluctuations, occurs with increasing pulse voltage. Systematic analysis reveals that back-hopping results from weakening antiferromagnetic coupling under high-voltage pulse excitation, leading to flipping of the reference layer. As temperature rises, the switching voltage associated with back-hopping decreases.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">This work presents a multi-objective Bayesian (MOB) optimization technique for co-optimizing device parameters and digital standard cell libraries (SDC) to deeply explore the technology design space. In contrast to the traditional design based on intrinsic device delay and power, the developed framework unifies the SDC characterizations and the MOB optimization algorithm. With 7nm FinFET as an example, the proposed framework achieves a 20.4% improvement in the power-delay product (PDP) and a 74% increase in hypervolume compared to traditional methods. The basic SDC including NAND, NOR, and XOR are considered with the ASAP7 PDK, and the full library could be covered.  This work provides a framework for automating the design-technology co-optimizations in advanced process nodes.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">A hybrid 2T0C DRAM cell with an n-type write transistor and a p-type read transistor is analyzed by modeling the characteristics of a-IGZO and LTPS-TFTs respectively. Both models are based on surface potential calculation and verified with experiments. Dynamic trap effect is involved as well. The simulation results demonstrate the advantage of hybrid 2T0C DRAM over full n-type DRAM in sense margin. The trade-off between memory window, retention and write/read speed has to be taken into account to design the read transistor size.

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">Defect generation and evolution in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) play a crucial role in the reliability and performance of electronic devices utilizing this 2D material. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) simulations to investigate three key aspects: the formation of native defects during device fabrication, the degradation process through defect generation, and the impact of defects electrical properties of h-BN. Our findings reveal that nitrogen vacancies are the most common defects in h-BN, with a formation energy of approximately 3.5 eV lower than that of boron vacancies and it has a strong effect on the electrical properties of h-BN. The presence of water molecules during metal deposition significantly reduces the formation energy of both nitrogen and boron vacancies by 4 eV and 5.5 eV respectively, highlighting the importance of high-vacuum fabrication environments. We identify two primary degradation pathways of h-BN: an in-plane and out-of-plane defect propagation compatible with filament formation in resistive switching applications, and a layer-confined defect generation that can lead to increased device variability. These results provide crucial insights for improving the reliability of h-BN-based devices and optimizing their performance in various applications, including memristors and transistors.</div></details>

However, the challenges of large-area preparation of MXene films have limited their development in the fields of wearable electronics. In this work, we used a surface modification method to prepare Janus MXene film with distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties on each surface, and used phase-interface transfer method for preparing large-area and high-quality MXene films.

    <div class="abstract">Understanding pixel-to-pixel (P-P) variance of dark current and photoresponse from individual pixels in image sensors is crucial to address artifacts, noise, and photoresponse inaccuracies in the overall imaging process. Specifically, well-calibrated pixel-to-pixel variance and specific photoresponse statistics of the raw output data help to identify the unavoidable error contributions from individual pixels, thus enabling compensation through computational image processing or readout circuits. This is particularly vital for emerging image sensors based on 2D materials integrated with silicon, which often utilize readout circuits distinct from traditional CCD and CMOS sensors. This work investigates pixel-to-pixel variance in graphene-silicon Schottky photodiodes, assessing the feasibility of large-scale fabrication, uniformity of dark current, and photoresponse in small-scale arrays. The array-based pixel statistics investigated in this study have potential implications for designing in-sensor processing and developing accurate statistical estimation methods for imaging in astronomy, biomedical, and spectroscopy.</div></details>

However, classical RRAM-based CNNs suffer from performance degradation from weight quantization and device non-idealities, and resource under-utilization due to mismatches between weight matrices and crossbar arrays. In this work, we propose RRAM-based isotropic CNNs that enhance model robustness and improve resource utilization concurrently. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the isotropic CNNs yield up to 3.74% and 12.61% accuracy improvement under quantization and non-idealities, respectively. Moreover, they increase the utilization rate by 5.2-13.4% in typical network architectures. These results make our design a highly robust and efficient RRAM-based CNN solution.</div></details>

By integrating physics-based features with data-driven methodologies, this model facilitates transparent, interpretable, and actionable insights into magnetization reversal processes, addressing longstanding challenges in mesoscale physics.
Magnetization reversal in nanomagnets is a cornerstone phenomenon for advancing spintronic devices, demanding novel analytical approaches to decode its complexity. Leveraging the capabilities of the extended Landau free-energy model alongside topological data analysis (TDA), this research bridges the gap between microstructures and macroscopic properties. Persistent homology (PH), ridge regression (RR), and principal component analysis (PCA) are employed to quantify magnetic domain complexities, identify energy contributions, and visualize magnetization dynamics.

    <div class="abstract">Materials science is a domain characterised by ‘small’ datasets (i.e., < 10,000 datapoints) of critical properties that govern performance of various applications and devices. For instance, there are no large, reliable datasets available for several key ‘performance determining’ metrics in energy applications, such as diffusivities in battery electrodes, carrier recombination rates in photovoltaics, and molecular adsorption energies for catalysis. On the other hand, there are reasonably ‘large' datasets (> 100,000 datapoints) available on some properties, such as, bulk formation enthalpies, computed band structures, and crystal structures across wide chemical spaces. Thus, if key chemical, compositional, and structural trends can be captured in available large datasets and subsequently transferred (or re-learnt), it will enable the use of deep learning and graph based neural network models in smaller datasets as well. Hence, my talk will explore the utility of current transfer learning (TL) approaches that are available for computational materials science and identify optimal ways to employ TL-based strategies. Specifically, TL involves training a neural network model on a larger dataset and subsequently retraining a fraction of the model on a smaller dataset. I will quantify the accuracy, transferability, and efficiency of TL models compared to models that have been trained from scratch. Finally, I will focus on TL models that can generalise over multi-properties during pre-training and can efficiently be re-trained on small datasets, which pave the way towards creating more general, foundational models, in the near future.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">There is a clear need in advanced manufacturing to develop Digital Twins that combine AI/ML with physics-based multiscale models to understand structure-property-processing relationships in materials. Additive manufacturing (AM) is one such transformative technique that allows creation of components with complex geometries layer-by-layer that are prohibitively difficult to achieve with traditional manufacturing techniques. Existing commercial and open-source software allow users to carry out materials simulations but lack predictive power to model manufacturing processes with complex thermal history and do not allow users the flexibility to design microstructures and hence functionality tailored to suit their specific needs. We aim to overcome this critical barrier by developing a high-performance user-friendly Digital Twin that will enable end users to exhaustively explore, identify and design time-dependent AM protocols that achieve tailor-made microstructures. A subset of the processing conditions that lead to the most promising microstructures and functionality will then be experimentally manufactured and validated. Our Digital Twin employs a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) based model of the AM process to simulate microstructural evolution for a diverse set of experimentally relevant processing conditions and uses AI/ML to explore the relationship between microstructural features and processing conditions. We also present probabilistic machine learning methodologies, namely Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Probabilistic Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) algorithms for precise dimensional control and uncertainty quantification in additive manufacturing.</div></details>
