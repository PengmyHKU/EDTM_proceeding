    <div class="abstract">Despite considerable advancements in electronic devices based on 2D materials, their performance suffers
from the lack of suitable gate insulators. Here, we focus on two promising insulators: Strontium titanate(SrTiO3), a high-κ perovskite used with MoS2 to create high-performance n-type field-effect transistors (FETs) and bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se), whose native oxide (Bi2SeO5) serves as a gate dielectric. We evaluate the main performance criteria and suitability of these insulators as gate dielectrics based on multi-scale simulations (DFT and TCAD).</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">In this work, we carried out an overlay-aware variation study on Flip FET (FFET) considering the impact on RC parasitics induced by the lithography misalignment in backside processes, and benchmarked it with CFET in terms of the power-performance (PP) and variation sources. The iso-leakage frequency degrades up to 2.20% with layout misalignment of 4 nm. It’s found that the Drain Merge resistance degrades significantly with misalignment increasing and is identified as the major variation source.  Through careful DTCO with design rule optimization, the variation can be greatly suppressed, while the resistance fluctuation of the DM also drops substantially. Monte Carlo random experiments were also conducted, validating the variation reduction. Comparing with the CFET featuring self-aligned gate and much less overlay induced misalignment,  fortunately, FFET’s PP is still better except when misalignment reaches 8 nm, which is out of spec and nearly  impossible. Considering the variabilities induced by the high aspect ratio processes, CFET still faces big challenges compared with FFET.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">The application of nanosecond laser annealing (NLA) for low-thermal-budget Ti silicide (TiSix) backside contact in Backside Power Delivery Network (BSPDN) is investigated. Silicon pre-amorphization reduces surface roughness by 90% and decreases energy density by 30%, enabling high-quality TiSix film by NLA. Through precisely controlling the amorphous silicon thickness and energy density, self-limited ultrathin Ti silicide is achieved. Multiphysical simulations show that the NLA-induced TiSix process can maintain Cu/low-k interconnect temperature below 400°C for BSPDN.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">Traditional transistor fabrication requires separate doping processes for both n-type and p-type field-effect transistors (FETs), which becomes increasingly challenging as device dimensions shrink. This paper explores the dual functionality of MoS₂ in nFETs and pFETs through the selection of contact metals. N-type characteristics can be achieved in p-type MoS₂ by using a low workfunction semimetal, allowing for the fabrication of both nFETs and pFETs on the same channel material without additional doping. Our approach simplifies the fabrication process and minimizes inter-device gaps.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">Novel stacked-VFET (VFETST) structure was proposed to overcome contact poly pitch scaling limitation. This study examined the DC/AC performance of VFETST for source-drain-source (SDS) and drain-source-drain (DSD) schemes. As a result, SDS outperformed DSD because of DC coupling by the low source potential. Although RC delay was slightly degraded by 11.5% in SDS compared to VFETs with lateral connection, SDS achieved a significant 36.8% area reduction.

The dynamic resistance (R_dyn) of the proposed design is 3Ω  which is >10X lower as compared to the foundry-provided design (31.93 Ω), providing substantially lower clamping voltage (~12V) than the oxide breakdown limit (16V). </div></details>

    <div class="abstract">We present multisensory-integration devices by adopting the in-material multimodal physical computing of novel Bi2O2Se ferroelectric semiconductor, which enables the simultaneous detection and perception of visual, audio, thermal, bolometric, and electrical stimuli. The non-volatile ferroelectric characteristics achieve an impressive on/off ratio exceeding 10⁶ and a memory window of approximately 4 V, demonstrating significant potential for non-volatile memory applications. We demonstrate the fusion responses for optical-thermal, optical-electrical, and optical-bolometric signals, allowing for effective information pre-processing. In addition, the stochastic resonance model is introduced to decouple the respective signals within the fusion response, addressing the challenge of high-precision signal separation in noisy environments.

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">Chemical biomarkers in the central nervous system can provide valuable quantitative measures to gain insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, has been found to be upregulated in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, chronic pain, and migraines. However, quantitatively monitoring glutamate release in situ has been challenging. This work presents a novel class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting sensors, with dimensions as low as 50 by 50 µm2, can detect real-time changes in glutamate within the biologically relevant concentration range. Experiments exploiting the hippocampal circuit in mice models demonstrate the capability of the sensors in monitoring glutamate release via electrical stimulation using acute brain slices.  These advances could aid in basic neuroscience studies and translational engineering, as the sensors provide a diagnostic tool for neurological disorders. Additionally, adapting the biofuel cell design to other neurotransmitters can potentially enable the detailed study of the effect of neurotransmitter dysregulation on neuronal cell signaling pathways and revolutionize neuroscience.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">Deterministic growth of a single-phase material with a low defect density is essential for achieving phase-sensitive properties uniformly and on demand in a scalable manner. While layered materials exhibit various polytypes with significantly different crystal symmetries and properties, the small difference in free energies between polytypes makes phase control challenging [1]. Here, we report the deterministic growth of bilayer MoS2 films with a hexagonal single phase over a large area using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. In layer-by-layer growth, forming single Mo atom seeds on top of the first-grown MoS2 layer prior to the second-layer growth ensures deterministic stacking of the second layer. Density functional theory suggests that these atomic seeds serve as nucleation sites, guiding the crystal growth of the hexagonal phase and preventing the formation of the rhombohedral phase. </div></details>

    <div class="abstract">2D layered materials, including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) allow the scaling down to atomically thin thicknesses and possess unique physical properties under dimensionality confinement. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process is the most popular approach for all kinds of 2D materials due to its high yield and quality. Nevertheless, the need for high temperature and the relatively long process time within each cycle hinders commercial development in terms of production cost. However, the transfer procedure has become one of the major limitations of the overall performance. In my talk, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) was used to synthesize Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) through a plasma-assisted selenization process of metal oxide (MOx) at a low temperature as as shown in Figure 1. Compared to other CVD processes, ICP facilitates the decomposition of the precursors at lower temperatures. We create the phase/structure-engineered-1T/2H 3D-hierarchical 2D materials derived from the MOx 3D-hierarchical nanostructures through a low-temperature plasma-assisted selenization process with controlled shapes grown by a glancing angle deposition system (GLAD), as shown in Figure 2.  In addition, a plasma-assisted selenization process (PASP) converted monolayer MoS2 to Janus MoSSe was demonstrated. Various spectroscopies, microscopies, and electrical characterizations were conducted to systematically investigate the MoSSe samples that were synthesized at various temperatures.The applications, including (1) water splitting, (2) gas sensors, (3) batteries, and (4) resistive change memory, will be reported.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">In this work, we studied the effect of DC stress at room temperature on the polarization strength and dielectric constant of HfxZr1-xO2 film capacitors, as well as the retention of this effect. We found that under DC stress, the device changes from a significant non-polarized characteristics to a gradually increased polarization in the low-voltage range. Therefore, it is understood the device exhibits a certain phase transition from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic phase. The polarization decreases after a long time of recovery, suggesting it returns to a state close to the initial state. Accordingly, under DC stress, the dielectric constant of the device gradually decreases, and after recovery, it gradually returns to a k value close to the initial state.

    <div class="abstract">In the DRAM capacitor field, due to the electrode TiN oxygen-gettering nature, an additional oxide layer at the interface of the capacitor was inevitably made. To prevent the formation of oxide layer, we adopted AlN as oxygen diffusion blocking layer (ODBL) and optimized the thickness of this interface layer. Moreover, AlN acted as ODBL could take into account both oxidation resistance and electrical properties, which positively contributed to the improvement of interface quality in the DRAM capacitor.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">To advance DRAM technology, balancing high permittivity with reliability remains a critical challenge. This study achieves ultra-high permittivity (~67) and low leakage (3E-8 A/cm2 at 0.8 V) in hafnium-based films through combined modulation of oxygen vacancy (VO) and Zr content. TDDB and endurance tests confirm the superior reliability of these films. By adjusting ozone dose time during atomic layer deposition (ALD), oxygen vacancies are flexibly controlled, influencing phase ratio to induce morphotropic phase boundary and significantly enhance permittivity. The synergistic effect of Zr content further boosts permittivity while mitigating reliability issues. This co-modulation strategy overcomes traditional trade-offs between high permittivity and reliability, providing a promising approach for next-generation high-performance DRAM applications.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">This study proposes an enhanced reliability testing framework for GaN transistors, utilizing two distinct reliability test protocols. The first protocol, a successive multi-stage compliance ramp voltage sweep (MSC-RVS), incrementally increases the voltage to the gate breakdown threshold with varying current compliance, allowing a detailed analysis of failure progression in GaN devices. MSC-RVS enables modeling of the physics of failure mechanisms as functions of temperature and voltage through stage-specific electrical and physical failure analysis. The second protocol employs a constant voltage stress (CVS) scheme, applying fixed current compliance while varying voltage levels. CVS testing under different voltage and temperature conditions supports parameter fitting of the physics of failure models, calibration, and subsequent device lifetime predictions (extrapolation). This study, conducted at room temperature, highlights a multimodal failure mechanism within the device, revealing different regions susceptible to degradation. Three primary failure regions were identified: Schottky, Passivation, and PiN, each associated with unique failure modes: (A) Schottky-only breakdown, (B) Schottky with passivation breakdown, and (C) combined Schottky with PiN/passivation breakdown. The findings provide valuable insights into the multimodal failure pathways in p-GaN gate HEMTs, advancing the understanding of their reliability under varied stress conditions.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">The capacitor-less two-transistor configuration (2T0C) brings further possibility for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) scaling down. Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML MoS2) has a relatively wide band gap and low leakage current, which can be applied to 2T0C cell. In this work, 1-2L MoS2 transistors based 2T0C DRAM cells are fabricated. The threshold voltages (Vth) of MoS2 transistors are modulated via a simple illumination process to make an operation balance between write transistors and read transistors. Moreover, the capacitive coupling effect at the storage-node (SN) could be optimized by a read pulse compensation. Finally, we demonstrate 2T0C DRAM cell based on 1-2L MoS2 with a retention time (tret) of 31.1s and low leakage current below 10-15A/μm, at the hold voltage (Vhold) of 0V.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">The creation of artificial neural systems that replicate human skin’s tactile perception capabilities has transformative potential for applications like prosthetics, virtual reality, and smart sensing. Current systems often integrate pressure sensors, memory units, and signal processing circuits to emulate sensory neurons. However, challenges remain in achieving miniaturization, high-density integration, and optimal performance due to reliance on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). This study introduces a monolithic, three-dimensional (3D) integrated artificial neural system based on ferroelectric HfxZr1-xO2. Utilizing the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) state of hafnia films, positioned between orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, the system achieves high piezoelectric performance, critical for sensing. The MPB-based sensor is seamlessly integrated with a self-rectifying ferroelectric tunnel junction memory and silicon-based signal processors. Experimental results demonstrate pressure sensing capabilities over a 1–50 kPa range with a sensitivity of 0.35 mV/kPa. The system also exhibits real-time frequency modulation via precise tuning of hafnia's functional properties, offering significant advancements in miniaturized and CMOS-compatible artificial sensory technologies.</div></details>

We incorporate this core model for 2DFETs with the sub models, including mobility degradation, velocity saturation, subthreshold swing degradation, short channel effect and self-heating in BSIM-CMG. This model is validated against measurements from state-of-the-art MoS2-based FETs.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">Ultra-compact and energy-efficient circuits are crucial for edge application. In the literature, an area and energy-efficient circuit based on band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) using partially depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (PDSOI) MOSFETs with standard SOI technology has been proposed. However, PD-SOI technology is costly due to the expensive “smart-cut” method to fabricate SOI wafers. Therefore, in this work, we propose a bulk MOSFET design with separate body contact and laminated well technique to enable BTBT's current collection. This is followed by the implementation of a Leaky integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron using mixed-mode simulation in TCAD with a well-calibrated deck to demonstrate spiking neuron. The simulation confirms that the laminated wells successfully enable hole storage in the body, facilitating effective LIF neuron operation in bulk technology.</div></details>

    <div class="abstract">As the critical dimensions of interconnect scaling, the enhancement of surface scattering increases the resistivity, contributing to the reduction in electromigration lifetime. Besides, the enhanced surface scattering can lower surface conductivity, resulting in cross-sectional current crowding and potentially decreasing the interconnect's electromigration resistance. Through finite element simulation, this work demonstrates the appearance of this extra decrement when the positive feedback between the Joule heat and resistivity is enhanced. As the metal's electric and thermal conductivity degrade with scaling, the cross-sectional crowding effect becomes significant, resulting in the electromigration stress increment by 10%, 33%, and 7% for Cu, Co, and Ru compared to the uniform current case at 9 nm thickness. This work reveals a potential influence on EM lifetime at advanced technology nodes and highlights Ru as an alternative interconnect metal that can effectively resist this adverse effect.</div></details>

    <details><summary class='abstract'>Abstract</summary>
    <div class="abstract">Temperature Dependence will complicate the noise problem of FinFET devices. Our experiments show that Flicker noise is obviously affected by high temperature, and shows different temperature dependence under different gate bias. That is, at low gate bias, high temperature makes the flicker noise of the device lower than that at room temperature, while at high gate bias, high temperature makes the flicker noise of the device higher than that at room temperature. A new physical-based model is used to analyze the temperature dependence of flicker noise. The decrease of high temperature noise at low bias is mainly affected by the decrease of Hooge parameter, and the increase of high temperature noise at high bias is mainly affected by the access resistance induced noise. This increase in noise due to high temperatures is likely to be more significant in future GAAFET and CFET devices.</div></details>
